grid part 2 is navbar


this example shows placing emphasis using display2 and text-muted. 
dont use only bold in the text to be highlighted, increase the contrast
with bold and text-muted

row is justify-content-center
columns is text-center. 


the example uses 2 columns text and image.
is the navbar API consistent w/column? 

what dies thsi imply for grphing API?
