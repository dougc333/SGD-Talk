00:00 All right, let's real quickly
00:01 review using the routes
00:03 creating and using the routes.
00:04 So, we start out going to config
00:06 this is in __init__.py
00:08 Go here and we say add route
00:09 and we give the route a name
00:11 and a URL. And that URL may or may not contain variables.
00:16 We saw in the release example
00:18 for an individual release
00:19 there's actually two variables interspersed
00:21 into the URL there that we could grab out
00:23 which is pretty awesome.
00:25 And then we're going to create a view method
00:28 and apply the route name to be the name passed there.
00:32 And then things will be better for you
00:34 just keeping track
00:35 if you do some organizations.
00:37 So we'll use the help template in the home folder.
00:40 The name of the function is help and so on.
00:42 But there's no reason they have to correspond
00:44 other than it helps you link these things together
00:47 because there's no other real way to know
00:50 what links where.
00:51 To get the value passed in the URL.
00:53 So if somebody said /help/installing
00:58 We're going to go to the request.
00:59 We'll go to the matchdict
01:00 then we say get topic and it's going to give us installing.
01:03 And what I've done here is I've passed overview
01:05 as a second parameter there
01:06 so for some reason
01:08 no topic is passed or it's not found
01:10 we're going to pull back some kind of default help
01:12 we can show them
01:13 instead of showing a 404
01:14 like here's an overview of the thing.
01:16 You asked for help that didn't exist.
01:18 So you're going to get just an overview.
01:20 And that's really is all there is to it.
