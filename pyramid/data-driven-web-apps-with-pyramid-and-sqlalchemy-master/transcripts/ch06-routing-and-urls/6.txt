00:00 So let's round out the rest of the URL structure
00:02 we're going to use for our site.
00:04 So we're going to have a few more things that we'd like to do.
00:06 We've saw that we've got our home stuff
00:08 we got some packaged things.
00:09 We actually want a few more things going on here
00:11 in the package world.
00:13 We want a URL that looks like this.
00:16 So, we're going to go /projects/SQLAlchemy/releases.
00:20 and that will show all the various releases.
00:24 We also want one like this.
00:27 It's starting to stretch a little off the screen
00:29 with this tiny resolution I have for recording.
00:32 This is not correct.
00:33 But we're going to go to the project.
00:35 Specify the project like SQLAlchemy
00:36 and then get the releases, and get the details
00:38 for a particular one, so like, /releases/117.
00:43 This one will list them all.
00:44 We interact with one, this is going to be the details.
00:47 So let's go over here.
00:49 Let's call this releases.
00:51 And I'll keep with my little example
00:53 of having the slash on
00:56 and not on on the end there.
00:58 Maybe put a space to show the grouping.
01:01 Actually, this one we'll just call release version.
01:05 Right, there's only going to be one.
01:08 Okay, all that has to do with PackageController.
01:10 Let's go add these releases here.
01:14 This URL. So, and the PackagesController.
01:17 We're going to need something again, like this.
01:20 And sometimes it's handy to have a URL structure up there
01:25 to remind you what's coming in.
01:31 I guess I'll stick with that for now.
01:32 So we could put this here. Total cleanup.
01:35 So the name, kind of remember these releases
01:38 have to match exactly, so let's put releases.
01:43 Again with a slash, and then the fully releases.pt.
01:47 Again we're going to get the package name
01:49 and we're going to pass it on to the view.
01:51 But we're also going to have to pass the releases.
01:53 We'll do that later. Let's remind ourself.
01:56 Something like the releases are going to be some kind of list.
01:59 Maybe like this.
02:05 So we'll just say releases there.
02:08 Again we have this release version one.
02:10 So let's go put, that'll be our final details.
02:14 We're only going to need one of those.
02:18 So we have release version, and also let's copy the URL
02:21 so we remember the data that we have to work with.
02:27 So we're going to have package name and a release version.
02:32 Let's go ahead and grab that data like so.
02:35 Over package name and the release version.
02:38 Let's name this is the same here.
02:43 And there for now.
02:48 Okay, so this is all looking really good.
02:50 Let's just make sure that it works.
02:55 So we've got Pyramid, should still work.
02:58 And we should have releases, which is going to say
03:00 "Here are the releases."
03:02 And then again, one, two, three.
03:06 There's our details for that particular release.
03:08 Okay, it looks like that routing is all in place.
