00:00 Alright let's start writing some code to do with routing.
00:03 Let's being by reviewing the Git repository.
00:07 Now we have Chapter 6 that's the chapter that we're on
00:10 and again, here is an exact copy
00:12 of what we're starting with.
00:13 This is just copying over Chapter Five's
00:15 materials the template stuff.
00:17 It's going to stay that way, this one is the one
00:20 I'm going to work on, so this one is changing.
00:22 Now, I'm not going to go over and
00:24 over again setting up this in PyCharm.
00:27 If you need help with that be sure to check out the previous
00:30 previous chapter where we did that.
00:32 But I will show you one quick thing
00:34 I'll go ahead and go through the steps and have a shortcut
00:36 for the rest of the things going on here.
00:38 So let's go over to this folder.
00:42 Now over here remember where the development.ini
00:45 and production.ini there's no venv
00:48 There's no virtual environment.
00:49 And there's a couple of steps to go through
00:51 creating it and activating it and it's also
00:54 good to update pip and setuptools cause
00:57 setuptools at the time of this recording is
00:59 11 versions out of date, oh my goodness.
01:01 So instead of typing that over and over again
01:04 I've created this alias venv, which runs
01:09 python3 -m venv, virtual environment called that
01:14 and then it's going to activate it
01:16 and then it's going to update the tools
01:17 and then just let you know it worked.
01:19 So I'm going to be running this from the rest of the time
01:20 and this is the thing I've created, it's not a Python thing
01:22 so either make a batch file, or put this in you
01:26 bash.rc or your .bashrc or zshrc whatever you're using.
01:33 Okay, look's like everything is good
01:36 notice it activated it, and even
01:40 got the new version right there.
01:41 Okay so we're going to just drop this under PyCharm.
01:46 Let's go ahead and add that vcs root.
01:50 Alright, in this chapter what we're going to do
01:52 is we're going to build up the routing URL structure
01:54 and the basic sort of layout in
01:58 terms of the views and what not.
02:00 We're not going to implement all of them, but
02:02 at least we'll get some place holders in place.
02:05 We'll just make sure things run and click down here
02:07 we should have our virtual environment. We do.
02:13 The one in routing looks like it's working.
02:16 Now remember for this to work, we also have to say
02:18 python setup.py develop, we can do that here.
02:23 Or we can go over here if we click.
02:25 in the right spot right there, see it runs setup task
02:29 develop would be the same thing.
02:35 Okay, you should be able to run this.
02:38 Looks like it's working let's
02:39 just make sure we can open it up, great.
02:42 Everything's good here's our fake data that we showed.
02:44 Alright.
