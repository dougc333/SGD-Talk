00:00 It looks we'll be able to call create_user
00:01 over from our Account Controller
00:03 but, you know, let's actually try it.
00:07 Let's go over here and register.
00:08 Actually, let's first look in the database
00:09 and see that there is no user with that name.
00:19 So we'll check the email equals michael@talkpython.fm.
00:26 Zero rows, okay. Now let's go register.
00:32 Alright, it seemed to work. Seemed to register.
00:35 Rerun our query. Boom, look at that.
00:39 User 85 has been created.
00:41 Here's Michael Kennedy, there's the email address I passed.
00:44 We got our default values of created_date.
00:46 Last logon, login we didn't set the profile image
00:49 but I don't really know what to put there for now.
00:51 So we're going to leave that alone.
00:53 But check out this password.
00:54 That is one gnarly-looking password.
00:56 So apparently 150,000 times some custom salt
01:00 a whole bunch of crazy so this is really really good.
01:03 This is, this should be totally fine for our password story.
01:07 Oh, sure looks like we're able to create an account
01:09 and register. Maybe we should try to login.
