00:00 We've seen over here that our login
00:02 and register still appear even though
00:04 we are technically logged in.
00:08 If I go there, we are technically logged in.
00:11 So let's fix that.
00:12 This is part of the shared layout template up here.
00:18 We'll go down to this section here.
00:21 Put a little separation for these.
00:24 We'll have some kind of condition here.
00:26 tal:condition, not userid.
00:31 So we can communicate back to this template
00:33 what the userid was.
00:36 It turns out that this gets to be
00:37 challenging to always do this in the right place.
00:40 But let's do it for a minute and then we'll fix it.
00:45 This one, of course, we're going to
00:46 change the account and logout.
00:55 Log out doesn't exist yet, but easy enough.
00:57 So this might seem like a great idea
00:59 but if we pull it up, not so much.
01:02 So it turns out that if we do it this way
01:05 every single part of our site
01:09 is going to have to always pass the userid.
01:12 We're going to do that now and we're going to fix it in the next chapter.
01:14 Let's go over, we need the HomeController.
01:20 Here we have to have userid
01:26 and pass the request.
01:28 I'm going to show you a better way.
01:29 But for now, this is what we're going to do.
01:33 We don't have it everywhere.
01:34 It's going to fail. But let's just see that it works on the homepage.
01:37 Boom, it's back and look at this, account and logout
01:39 because we're logged in that's so awesome.
01:40 'course if I click on account, it fails.
01:43 Let's go work on that one. That one's easy.
01:52 So I'm just going to put these on the rest, it's all the same.
01:56 Alright, look everything is back.
01:57 It looks like its all working.
01:59 We can even go to the packages.
02:00 That was super annoying
02:02 but it is nice that it's driving this.
02:04 We're going to fix that, like I said.
02:05 But here we have our site up and working
02:08 with user sessions and cookies.
02:09 Let's do one more thing.
02:10 I'll fully quit Firefox and come back
02:12 just to see we're still logged in.
02:17 Logged in, of course in a private window, not so much.
02:21 Log in and register versus account and log out, awesome.
