00:00 We have our data submitted
00:01 to this register post action method here.
00:04 However we're doing nothing with it right?
00:07 So let's do something.
00:08 Let's actually create the user
00:09 and save them to the database.
00:12 Okay so what we're going to do in this chapter
00:15 is we're going to do kind of the ugly way of doing this.
00:18 And then we're going to improve dramatically
00:21 upon that when we get to the validation
00:23 and other sort of data handling things.
00:26 I'll show you the naive straight forward way
00:28 and then a better way in a minute.
00:31 Remember when we ran this we saw that
00:33 the POST has really the data that we're after.
00:37 And so what we're going to do is we're
00:38 going to get that data out here.
00:39 We'll say email equals request.Post.get('email')
00:45 We could of course get it out like this
00:48 but if it's not there for some reason
00:50 somehow this thing got submitted incorrectly.
00:52 Boom key error. So if we do it this way we can test and say
00:55 "No no the emails supposed to be there." something like that.
00:59 Alright so we could also get the name. We'll do the password.
01:07 So that gets the three pieces of data out
01:09 and then what we want to do is we want to check
01:13 hey is this correct? So we'll do something to this effect.
01:16 We'll say, if not email, or not name or not password for now.
01:24 Normally it would say if you didn't
01:25 set the email send a message emails required.
01:28 If the name... we'll do that later.
01:29 For now we'll just say error equals some
01:33 required fields are missing.
01:35 In this case we don't want to go on
01:37 and try to create the user
01:38 we want to just send them back to the form.
01:42 Over here though when we are... and here
01:44 we'll have a little... create user
01:48 and then we'll have a redirect.
01:50 So we'll just say return... lets go over
01:53 here and import HTTPExceptions as x
01:57 something like that right? Keep it short.
02:01 We'll do HTTPNotFound and it's going to be /account.
02:04 So once you register it's just going to
02:06 send you to your account page like
02:07 "Hey welcome new user."
02:10 so how do we communicate this error back to them?
02:13 What we want to do is lets actually add something over here.
02:18 And we have some piece of data
02:21 I'll have a DIV and the class will be error-message like that
02:25 We'll define that in a second and then we're going to put error
02:28 and we want to say only show the error section
02:33 if there is an error and of course we'd like that
02:35 to look error-like, right? So let's go to our site and say
02:43 Color is some kind of red. Let's darken it a tad.
02:49 Like that. If I run this you'll find it's not as amazing
02:53 as it seems like it's going to be. See why. You go here.
02:57 Register. Boom. No. Error. Where did that come from?
03:00 Well that came from the GET. That came from not here
03:05 but over here. See what we need to do is we need to
03:07 say errors None. Again we're going to make this better shortly.
03:14 So here we'll say error is the error message.
03:17 We can fact in line that if we want like so.
03:21 Let's try again but sure to rerun. Good. If I submit this
03:26 some required fields are missing. Well. That's pretty good
03:29 but watch this. If I say Michael and I say my email address
03:33 and I submit it. Everything is gone.
03:36 Do you know how frustrating that would be if this
03:37 was a big form with important stuff in it?
03:39 It's already a little frustrating. So what we need to do
03:42 is also carry that other information across so
03:45 email is you guessed it email and so on.
03:50 And for the same reason above
03:52 we need then pass these as None.
03:57 Great. Now the form actually needs to put that data back in
04:01 so lets go here to the end and say value equals $name
04:06 and similarly for all the rest. Password. Okay. Rerun it.
04:12 All this roundtripping should be working.
04:14 If I put Michael and my email address and I enter.
04:18 Look it stays. Very nice. But some errors are there.
04:21 So let's look back over here real quick.
04:24 It's coming through but first we're
04:26 pre-populating it with nothing.
04:27 You could put values if you wanted but if there's an error
04:30 we're actually going to not create the user.
04:33 Carry that information back and send the error message
04:36 in this case. And that's what just happened.
04:39 So let's just see what happens if we make it through.
04:41 We're not actually creating the user yet
04:42 but if we make it through. Boom.
04:45 Now we're in the account page. We passed the validation.
04:48 Now the step is going to be to come down here
04:50 and actually do something with this.
