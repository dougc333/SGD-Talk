00:00 Let's just round out this demo part of this chapter
00:04 by closing out what we're doing with the users.
00:06 We've done all of these things
00:07 and that let us explore working with forms.
00:09 Let's go ahead and add logout.
00:10 Technically this has nothing to do with forms
00:13 but we have been doing this user stuff
00:15 so let's just finish that up real quick.
00:17 So I already have this /account/logout route
00:22 and we're going to come over to here and we're just going to add
00:28 another little action method here. We'll say logout.
00:33 You'll see we don't need a renderer
00:35 and we don't need to set the get.
00:41 And we're going to return.
00:42 When somebody logs out
00:43 we got to figure out where do they go.
00:44 Let's return them to http found at just /, okay?
00:49 How do we log them out?
00:51 Well remember the way they're logged in
00:52 is they have a cookie that they're passing back and forth.
00:55 All we're going to do is delete that cookie
00:57 their session is gone.
00:59 So we have cookie_auth and it has a logout function.
01:03 And we give it the request, that's it.
01:07 Let's look really quick at that.
01:08 It just said to call back to say delete this
01:10 which goes to the response, deletes the cookie.
01:14 All right, well that should be pretty easy.
01:15 Let's try logging out.
01:20 Can see right now we're logged in.
01:22 We can go to our account page to click this.
01:24 Boom, login register.
01:26 I try to go back to account, can't go there.
01:30 We're logged out.
01:31 We got to go log in first.
01:33 Perfect, huh? All right, well that rounds out the user stuff.
