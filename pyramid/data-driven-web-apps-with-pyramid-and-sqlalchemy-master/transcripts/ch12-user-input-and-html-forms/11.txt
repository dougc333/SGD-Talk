00:00 Have the logic for login in in place.
00:02 We think. Haven't been able to test it yet.
00:04 Cause we have no log in form.
00:06 Let's do that real quick.
00:07 Over here in register, we honestly have basically
00:10 exactly what we need, minus one field so
00:13 let's just take that and put it over in login.
00:19 So put that there. We don't need the name.
00:22 Change this to login.
00:26 Think we're good. Let's try it.
00:29 I'm also not including the proper CSS.
00:36 So down here. After this one.
00:43 Alright login looks good.
00:44 We should totally make it look better but
00:47 user can not be found or the password was incorrect.
00:51 Well, let's try this with some data.
00:55 The letter a. Nope, still didn't work.
00:58 Let's try it with the actual log in details, ready?
01:02 Boom. Wow. Login is working. That's sweet.
01:05 So let's just go review real quick.
01:07 So over here, obviously this shows the form and
01:10 there is nothing super interesting there at this point.
01:13 But this is what is processing the POST. We get the email.
01:16 We don't bother checking that the email and password exist
01:18 because this will fail if they don't. Obviously.
01:22 I can feel further reasons
01:23 like they put in the wrong password or the wrong email.
01:25 But that certainly will fail if these are missing.
01:27 So that's sort of our double check right there.
01:30 For whatever reason
01:32 the value doesn't come back from the database we say
01:35 the user couldn't be found and we already saw that.
01:37 But if there is a user, we did a proper log in, then boom.
01:41 We over at account.
