00:00 We started off this chapter by demoing
00:02 how to insert data.
00:03 Let's actually summarize now here at the end.
00:06 So again, we're going to create a session
00:08 which is the corresponding unit of work
00:11 bit of syntax in SQLAlchemy.
00:13 Then we're just going to allocate some objects
00:15 so here we're going to create a package
00:17 and set its ID and its author
00:19 maybe create some releases, set the release
00:23 not package value, other properties similarly
00:26 release two, set its package.
00:28 We're going to add the package, call commit
00:30 whoosh, all three of those things
00:32 because of the relationships get inserted into the database.
00:36 Super easy.
