00:00 So far we've seen our homepage
00:01 is looking really sweet.
00:03 We don't have that much data yet
00:04 but it is data driven
00:06 and this is coming out of the database.
00:07 However, when we pull up the details
00:10 for one of the packages under project/{package_id}
00:13 well the details are not so much.
00:15 So that's what we're going to focus on in this video
00:18 on how to fix this.
00:19 Now, the actual design for this page
00:23 remember, remind you what this looks like
00:29 it looks like this.
00:30 It's got this little install instruction
00:31 whether or not it's the latest version
00:33 the ability to see all the releases
00:35 the details, the homepage, the maintainers
00:39 and so on, and so on.
00:40 All of this stuff.
00:41 It turns out the actual web design to do all that
00:45 would take quite a while
00:46 and we already spent a ton of time
00:47 back in the adding design
00:50 after the bootstrap chapter that we already did
00:53 on the homepage and this is really pretty similar.
00:55 So what I'm going to do is just quickly talk you through
00:57 what we got here. So here is some more html.
01:00 We're using the same, sort of, hero concept.
01:03 This time we've got that little install bit.
01:06 Whether or not it's the latest release
01:08 and how to switch from that. Same little stats.
01:11 Here instead of having the numbers though, we have the summary.
01:14 And the maintainers and we have the side bar
01:17 navigation thing. And then somewhere down here
01:20 we have the project details.
01:22 And we're using structured output html like stuff.
01:25 Now if this was just marked down
01:27 to be real easy to convert it to html
01:29 and actually show it properly formatted
01:31 but because most of it's restructured text
01:33 and I haven't found a good library for that
01:36 I just threw it into a pre
01:37 so we can just read it, all right.
01:39 So it's not going to be perfect but it's close enough.
01:42 So with this in place, you think we could load it up
01:44 but in fact, if I rerun it here
01:49 it's going to run into some problems.
01:50 'Cause we don't have the data.
01:52 Right so wait hold up, we need the actual package object
01:54 from the database. You just gave us a fake name.
01:57 This is not really the package object.
01:59 Our goal will be to implement the data access layer
02:03 and pass the right amount data over
02:05 make this view happy, right.
02:07 So working our package service and our controller.
