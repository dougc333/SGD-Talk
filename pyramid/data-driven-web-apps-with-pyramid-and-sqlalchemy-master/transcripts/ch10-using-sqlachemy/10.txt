00:00 Databases are really good at filtering and ordering.
00:03 Here's a function, find_all_packages
00:05 and the idea is I would like really
00:07 a list of all the packages in the database
00:10 showing the newest ones first
00:11 and the oldest ones last.
00:13 So we're going to do a query on package
00:15 and we don't do any filtering 'cause
00:16 you know, we said in the name, we want them all
00:19 but we are going to do an order by.
00:21 So we say query a package.orderby
00:24 and then we always express these operations
00:26 in terms of the type, so package.created.
00:29 And if we just said package, dot, created
00:30 it would order ascending by the created date
00:33 but we want descending, so we go to that descriptor created
00:37 and we say, .desc, we call the function
00:39 to reverse the sort and then we just say
00:42 give us all the packages, here they come.
