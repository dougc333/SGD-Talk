00:00 Now, before we get to the rest
00:01 of the course, let me just quickly introduce myself.
00:04 Hey, I'm Michael, feel free to reach out to me
00:07 on Twitter where I'm @mkennedy.
00:09 I've done a number of things
00:10 in the Python space, one is create the Talk Python
00:12 To Me podcast, where I've interviewed
00:14 a lot of people who were involved
00:16 in these various technologies, Mike Bayer
00:18 from SQLAlchemy, Chris McDonough, the founder of Pyramid.
00:22 I'll talk a little bit about some of those episodes
00:24 when we get to the right place
00:25 and how you can learn more.
00:27 But I started and run the Talk Python To Me podcast.
00:30 I also run the Python Bytes podcast
00:32 which is sort of a news one. Check that out.
00:35 And of course, I'm the founder
00:36 and one of the main authors at Talk Python Training.
00:39 Nice to meet you, I'm really excited you're in my course
00:42 now let's get started.
