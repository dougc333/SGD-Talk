00:00 This is not an introduction to Python course.
00:03 We do assume a little bit of working knowledge.
00:06 We assume that you have basic Python programming skills.
00:10 I would say if you're, what you might consider
00:12 an advanced beginner, you're totally
00:15 good to take this course.
00:17 We're going to use things like classes
00:18 and decorators and functions and so on
00:21 but we're not going to describe what a class is
00:24 or describe what a function is or things like that.
00:26 So make sure you have some basic working knowledge
00:29 of Python in order to take this course.
00:31 If you don't, consider taking my Python
00:33 Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps course.
00:35 That's all about learning Python.
00:38 So here we assume that you know Python.
00:40 We also assume that you know a little bit of HTML.
00:43 That if you look at HTML, at least you can make sense of it
00:45 you know what, say, an attribute is
00:48 what a class is, things like that.
00:50 We're not going to be doing too much advanced stuff with HTML.
00:54 I'm not sure if there is such thing as advanced HTML
00:56 but we're not going to be doing too much with it
00:59 but of course, this is a web class
01:01 and we're going to be doing a lot of HTML
01:03 but I assume that you can work with standard markup.
01:07 Similarly, we're going to be using CSS
01:09 and I'll talk a lot about what the selectors
01:11 and classes and design mean, and especially
01:14 when we get to the bootstraps section
01:15 and applying that to our website.
01:17 So we're not going to assume you know tons of it
01:20 but we're not starting from scratch with CSS either.
01:23 So basic HTML, CSS, and Python knowledge
01:26 that's what we assume you're starting with
01:28 and then we're going to build
01:30 our full-stack web app from there.
