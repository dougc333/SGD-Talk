00:00 When we talked about the incredible power
00:01 of the web, we saw some amazing web apps built.
00:04 Only some of them were built with Python.
00:06 Let's look at a whole bunch of other apps
00:08 web apps, built with Python.
00:10 I think it's always great to have some examples.
00:12 You know, maybe you're trying to convince your team
00:14 or your boss, or something like that.
00:16 "Hey, we should build this particular app we're trying
00:18 to launch in Python and here are five examples
00:21 of other apps that are similar, that are amazing."
00:23 So let's go through a quick list
00:24 to give you some ammunition.
00:27 You might be familiar with The Onion.
00:29 This is a fake news comedy site that's hilarious.
00:33 They post all sorts of crazy, outrageous news items
00:36 and that, of course, is built on Python.
00:39 Spotify, the music streaming service, their web app, Python.
00:43 NASA and JPL make heavy use of Python
00:46 for all their awesome space stuff.
00:49 Bitly, the URL shortening site that gets tons of traffic
00:54 does all sorts of analytics and stuff
00:56 around the URLs they shorten, Python.
00:59 Bitbucket, SurveyMonkey, Quora
01:03 what I think one of the very best online Q&A forums for
01:07 thoughtful, somewhat deep answers.
01:10 Not always great but pretty good, built with Python.
01:13 They're actually pretty enthusiastic users of Python.
01:15 If you look at their engineering blog
01:17 they often write about how they use and configure
01:20 and optimize Python for what they're doing.
01:22 Disqus the comment section that you can embed
01:25 into any web application.
01:27 If you go to either of my podcast sites, talkpython.fm
01:29 or pythonbytes.fm, you'll see at the bottom
01:31 this little Disqus section.
01:33 That is built with Python.
01:35 Many of their services are based on Python.
01:36 Instagram, an incredible amount of traffic goes
01:39 to Instagram, and they make heavy use and, again
01:41 are very passionate users of Python
01:43 and their engineering blog covers a lot of cool things
01:45 like how they disabled garbage collection, for example
01:49 to make their web apps run much faster.
01:52 Reddit, the front page of the internet, as some say
01:55 gets tons of traffic, I think it's in
01:57 the top ten websites on the internet
01:59 built with Python and SQLAlchemy.
02:02 Youtube, we already talked about that.
02:03 Youtube is amazing, they get millions of requests
02:06 per second and are based on Python.
02:08 The brand new relaunched PyPI, the Python Package Index
02:12 at pypi.org, is built with Python and Pyramid.
02:17 They get tons and tons of traffic
02:18 and they actually tried Flask, they tried Django
02:21 and they tried Pyramid and they decided Pyramid was
02:23 the best choice for what they were building.
02:26 Pinterest, also built on Python.
02:29 Paypal has some of their pricing services written
02:33 in Python, and these pricing services are called
02:35 by different parts of Paypal's infrastructure
02:38 and other services and websites to figure out
02:40 what the exchange rate is, what the fee is
02:43 that goes along with various transactions and so on.
02:45 That has two to three billion requests per day
02:49 written in Python with sub-millisecond
02:52 maybe just single millisecond response time.
02:54 It's pretty incredible.
02:56 Dropbox is a heavy user of Python, the client you get
02:59 on your machine, as well as much of
03:02 their backing services, Python.
03:03 In fact, Guido van Rossum, the guy
03:05 who created Python, works there
03:07 at least at the time of this recording
03:09 so you can bet that it's a real
03:10 center of the universe around Python.
03:13 And, last but not least, Talk Python.
03:16 All the Talk Python stuff, the training site
03:18 the podcast site, all that stuff is based
03:20 on Pyramid and Python.
03:21 It's been working out amazing.
03:23 We get incredible, high-performance web apps
03:26 that are easy to maintain.
03:28 We'll share a lot of the lessons
03:29 from that experience in this course.
03:32 Want to read more about all of these
03:33 how these companies are using Python?
03:35 Well, how about we use a little Python to get there.
03:37 Bitly/pyapp-25, that'll take you over
03:41 to an article where I pulled a lot of this stuff together
03:43 with more background info than I put in here.
