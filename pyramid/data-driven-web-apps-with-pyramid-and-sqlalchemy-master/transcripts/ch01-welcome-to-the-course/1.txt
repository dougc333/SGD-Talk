00:00 Hello and welcome to Data Driven Web Apps in Pyramid.
00:04 In this course, we are going to take the Pyramid web framework
00:07 which is a Python-based web framework
00:10 and we're going to build some amazing
00:12 data driven web applications.
00:14 We're going to use Bootstrap which is one
00:16 of the most popular CSS front end design frameworks
00:19 to make our web app we build in Python look great.
00:23 Of course, almost all web applications access databases.
00:27 At least the dynamic ones do.
00:29 And we're going to use the most popular
00:30 and powerful Python-based ORM called SQLAlchemy
00:34 to write Python classes and map those to our database.
00:39 Welcome, welcome, welcome
00:40 to Data Driven Web Apps in Pyramid.
00:43 We're going to have a great time building
00:45 some real world applications and learning
00:47 some real world ways to put them into production.
