00:00 Before we dig into all the code that we're going to write
00:02 and the technologies we're going to use
00:04 and the types of things we can even build
00:06 let's just take a moment and admire the
00:08 incredible power of the web.
00:10 The web is one of the most flexible
00:12 and certainly the most widely deployed
00:14 and used technology out there.
00:17 Think about YouTube.
00:19 YouTube is an amazing web application.
00:22 It really has brought video sharing to the entire world.
00:26 It also happens to be a Python-based web app
00:29 and handles millions of requests per second.
00:32 Think about Airbnb.
00:34 With this web application, and a unique sharing philosophy
00:38 they've literally transformed the way people travel
00:41 and stay in cities.
00:43 Netflix uses their web app to redefine
00:46 TV for many, many people.
00:49 In fact, this web app and their infrastructure
00:51 account for 35% of the bandwidth
00:54 of the United States in the evening.
00:56 That's pretty incredible.
00:58 Hey, let's throw one more in.
00:59 You're taking an amazing course
01:01 and you're going to be learning all about building web apps.
01:04 Here's another one, Talk Python Training.
01:06 This site is built, of course, on Python and Pyramid
01:09 and has taught a ton of people about Python.
01:12 In fact, many of the techniques and the lessons
01:15 learned in building this site
01:17 along with some of the others
01:18 I'm going to bring into this course.
01:21 So it's not just about looking out there
01:22 and seeing some incredible web apps built
01:24 it's also taking a pretty amazing web app
01:27 that I have built
01:28 and taking the lessons and techniques from that
01:30 and sharing them with you with Pyramid
01:32 SQLAlchemy, and so on.
01:35 Do you have an idea?
01:36 Something you want to build for everyone?
01:37 Well, the techniques and technology you're about to learn
01:40 will let you unleash this incredible power of the web
01:44 to bring your idea to life.
