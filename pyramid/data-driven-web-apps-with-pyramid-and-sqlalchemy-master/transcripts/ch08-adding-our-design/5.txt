00:00 With our hero in place, the next thing
00:01 just let's work top to bottom
00:03 to focus on is this, what I'm going to call the stats slice.
00:06 And that's here we have
00:07 number of projects, number of releases, number of users.
00:10 Now what we're going to get is getting a little bit of gray
00:12 a little bit darker, and then three little segments
00:15 maybe in the middle third.
00:17 Alright, let's do that.
00:19 So here's what we're working with.
00:21 We've got a divet that is PyPI stats
00:24 and in there we have stat, stat and stat.
00:27 Let's go and put that down here.
00:29 We have the stats.
00:31 This part is still going to be the gray slice
00:34 so we'll set the padding at 10 px and 0
00:37 so up and down but not on the right.
00:40 We'll set the background color.
00:42 Now, I've already copied this, or copied it down before.
00:45 It's ec, ec is the gray, so let's see
00:49 how we're doing already.
00:53 Looking pretty good.
00:54 Color seems to match, but of course
00:57 the text pieces not so much.
01:00 Let's set a border bottom
01:04 one PX solid and then a little bit darker
01:07 is going to be d3.
01:11 How does that look?
01:12 And there's a little border coming in
01:15 some orderly on the top.
01:18 I'll have the same thing, and then
01:20 let's set everything to align center.
01:24 How's it looking now?
01:26 Better, looking better.
01:28 Of course, that stuff's not vertical.
01:30 It has new lines in it because these are divs
01:32 but we can tell them to be in-line blocks
01:34 rather than block display, which we will fix those.
01:37 So let's focus on that part now.
01:41 So those are going to be contained within here
01:43 and they have the class stat so we can set
01:46 their style right here.
01:47 The display is going to be an in-line block
01:52 which should fix that wrapping or new lines.
01:56 I set the width to the other all equal space to 170.
02:01 If you wonder how I came up with these numbers
02:02 I was just playing with it before and that's what I came up
02:05 with that seemed decent.
02:06 So now they are kind of spaced out like we were hoping.
02:11 Let's do a little bit of padding.
02:12 Font size is 16, and then the color we have set to this
02:17 Again, I just got this straight off PyPI and wrote it down
02:19 so we could use it here.
02:21 There we go. Now it's looking pretty close.
02:26 It's not exactly right because we're not using
02:29 the same fonts, so let's go ahead and fix that now.
02:32 We're going to use fonts from Google
02:35 some of Google's free web fonts, and let's go ahead
02:37 and put those right here like so.
02:40 So we're going to use Source Sans Pro
02:45 and we're also going to use Font Awesome as well.
02:47 So let's go ahead and drop those in there, and that way
02:50 we can make things look a little bit nicer.
02:52 So if we come up to the body, come up here and set the font
02:56 to be Source Sans Pro or Helvetica or Arial
02:59 and then just some kind of Sans Serif.
03:01 So now we should be a little closer.
03:03 There we go.
03:04 Now, that's the final step to make these two
03:07 look exactly the same, okay, besides the Nav bar.
03:11 That's pretty good, right?
03:12 I think that little slice is here.
03:14 Now, no data is being passed in, right?
03:17 We're not actually computing that yet.
03:19 We'll do that when we get to the SQLAlchemy section.
03:21 But for now at least the place holders are there
03:24 and then when we get here we just need to say something like
03:29 this project count, like that, something to that effect.
03:33 Maybe a little more formatting.
03:35 But we don't have those numbers yet so we're just going to leave 0 for now.
03:39 Alright, that's the first two slices.
