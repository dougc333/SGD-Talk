00:00 Let's start her building by doing
00:01 a little bit of tearing down.
00:03 Okay, so over here, we've got our CSS in place.
00:06 For our layout, let's just do a quick tour.
00:10 We don't want all of this stuff.
00:12 We want to have more control, right?
00:13 This says every single page is going to have this stuff up here
00:17 and then, somewhere in the middle you'll have
00:20 you know, this inside of a 10, 10/12ths segment
00:25 a 5/6ths segment, you getta put your content
00:27 and we don't want that. We want this to be
00:33 having much more control here.
00:35 So we'll do something like this.
00:37 See where we're getting with that?
00:40 Better. Not great, but better.
00:44 We're here in the content, we're just going to have Home.
00:47 Don't know if we're going to end up using that Home CSS
00:50 but we'll leave this part for here for now.
00:52 It just says Home. I notice there's a lot of this
00:55 design stuff from the theme coming in here
00:58 and we want to go and start rolling some of that back.
01:03 Now, one thing we can do here is
01:05 I would like to keep a lot of the theme
01:07 that is already applied to this site
01:09 but, I don't like the red. I don't like this
01:12 huge margin up here, and things like that.
01:15 So, I want to put them back.
01:17 We could go and start working on the theme itself
01:20 one possibility. Another one, something I like to do
01:23 is when I'm getting started is I come over here
01:26 and I would maybe make a new style sheet
01:28 called Theme Overrides, and what the idea is
01:32 we're going to include that after the Theme up at the top
01:40 and into this section, we're going to put just a bunch
01:42 of changes that override some of the settings
01:44 that we don't like from the theme.
01:46 Alright, instead of typing this out, there's quite a few
01:48 let me just paste them and we'll review them. Okay?
01:51 So, in the body, we want the color to be mostly dark
01:54 and the background white, instead of having all the
01:56 padding and being red and so on.
02:00 Again, the font content of many things
02:03 we're going to reset here, but from the theme
02:05 so the colors are being set
02:07 you can see black and blue for some of the elements.
02:13 A lot of this is just color or underlying changes
02:16 really, really simple.
02:17 We're going to get to the nav bar in a minute
02:19 that's a bootstrap thing that we're going to use
02:21 so there's some changes to just change the color to match.
02:25 These change the color to match pi PI, not the default
02:29 so that's fine, and then here we've just
02:31 sort of reset the margin.
02:33 Okay, so let's see how we're doing now.
02:35 Here we go, something pretty white and clean and plain.
02:40 So let's try and go to work on this page next.
02:43 We're going to try to get this section in.
02:46 Some of this stuff here, these two pieces
02:49 and, actually, this is the real live one.
02:52 We are just going to have one column here, just to keep things
02:55 simple, so our data doesn't get too complicated.
