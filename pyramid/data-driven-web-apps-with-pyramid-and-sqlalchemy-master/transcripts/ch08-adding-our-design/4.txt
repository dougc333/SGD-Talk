00:00 So, here's where we want to be
00:02 but here's where we are.
00:04 Little bit of a difference, huh?
00:07 So let's focus on this
00:08 what I'm calling the hero section right here.
00:11 So we go over to our site
00:12 and we're going to have a hero
00:14 notice that PyCharm is finding the classes
00:17 used in HTML, and suggesting them here
00:19 that's pretty awesome.
00:20 And let's start with color.
00:23 Alright, obviously, this is just white and black
00:26 and that one is white fonts on a blue background.
00:31 So let's set the background color
00:33 and I'm going to take a color that I've already grabbed
00:36 from the design over there
00:39 and the color is going to be white.
00:44 Let's see what that does for us.
00:46 Nothing on that page.
00:48 Uh, a little bit better, not 100 percent.
00:51 Okay, so that's a start.
00:54 Let's set the padding, notice over here
00:57 there's a lot of space, and here, not so much.
01:04 We'll do 50 top and bottom and zero left and right.
01:09 Let's set the text align to be center.
01:12 The line height to be 1.0
01:15 and the font size is going to be 18 pixels, okay.
01:23 Little better, we still have some real weirdness
01:26 going on with that that's quite large, so let's fix that.
01:30 So that's going to be the hero eight one.
01:33 Now first of all, notice this going all the way across
01:36 and the font size is really wrong
01:38 so let's go to the font size and say that's 32 pixels
01:40 see what that does.
01:43 I think we need a little bit more to control this here
01:46 let's do starter.
01:54 There we go, that looks like pretty comparable font size.
02:00 Set the font weight to 400, that's a little bit bold.
02:03 And here we'll set the line height to 1.3
02:06 so it's a little bit more space
02:07 again text align is going to be centered just to be safe.
02:11 Here we go, getting a little bit closer.
02:13 Let's also make sure it doesn't change size in a weird way
02:17 so well set the max width, 810 pixels.
02:24 And also let's set the padding.
02:30 And one more thing, now that we set the max width
02:32 it looks like it's off to the left
02:33 so we're going to want to set the margin left to be auto
02:37 and the margin right to be auto
02:39 kind of like we did with our login box.
02:41 Okay, that's looking good.
02:43 Next up, let's just work our way down
02:45 this thing being all the way across
02:46 not so amazing, let's fix that.
02:48 So that is a forum control
02:53 and let's set the max width to be 550px.
02:58 And we also need to change the display style
03:01 cause right now I think it's in line
03:02 which you can't control some of these
03:03 so we'll do inline block, oh I typed minwidth I meant the set.
03:08 So we have the width, that looks pretty good
03:10 let's cycle back and forth.
03:12 Now the rounded edges verses square edges let's work on that.
03:19 We'll set that, we'll set the border radius
03:22 to something like two pixels. Here we go.
03:25 Now it's starting to look pretty close.
03:27 What else we got to do? Let's up the font size to 20 pixels.
03:32 Change the padding to 20 pixels as well.
03:38 See how we're doing. Oh, those look pretty similar.
03:41 Now the nav bar up top is changing the, sort of
03:44 vertical alignment, we haven't worked on that yet
03:46 we're just working on the blue hero
03:47 but boy those are good.
03:49 I notice this one is white and underlined
03:51 and this one is not, so let's go address that.
03:55 So that's going to be a hero
03:56 and there's only one hyperlink so we can just say a
04:00 and the color is going to be white
04:02 and the text decoration is going to be underline.
04:06 Boom, there it is.
04:08 It looks pretty good, the font size is tiny bit different
04:10 than what we're aiming for but that was also just an approximation.
04:13 So I think this hero piece is basically done.
04:17 Now this nap doesn't navigate anywhere
04:19 that's fine, but in terms of modeling
04:22 these two pieces here, I think this first hero slice
04:24 is good enough.
