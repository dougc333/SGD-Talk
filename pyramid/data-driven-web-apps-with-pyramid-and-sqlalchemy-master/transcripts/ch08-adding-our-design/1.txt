00:00 It's time to take what we've learned about
00:01 Bootstrap and templates and so on
00:04 and apply them to actually put the design
00:07 for our website in place.
00:09 We might leave a few details out
00:11 until we get to the right location later
00:13 but for the most part, let's start by
00:15 ripping out this design and putting in a new design.
00:19 I'll try to not waste time doing this
00:21 but I'll also try not to skip over
00:23 too much stuff for you so hopefully
00:25 I can find a decent balance there
00:28 'cause there's a lot of details in
00:29 some of the CSS and so, alright.
00:30 So this is what we have so far.
00:32 We actually have this sort of
00:33 data-driven even though it's not
00:35 out of a database, it is you know
00:36 a model provided to the template, changing it here.
00:40 This is what we want.
00:42 Now if you look carefully this is not PyPI.org.
00:48 It's a slightly different version.
00:50 It has 96 projects and it's running on localhost.
00:54 So this is what we want to build.
00:55 I have the new releases here, some of the top stuff.
00:58 Click on it, you get details and history, all about it.
01:02 So we're going to build this and notice up here
01:04 I have a login and register.
01:06 Some of these things should look
01:08 a little more familiar to you
01:09 now that we've talked about Bootstrap
01:10 if they didn't already.
01:12 Notice where it says this is the fake site.
01:15 So this is is where we're going
01:16 and let's just focus on a couple of things.
01:18 Let's design out this front page here.
01:21 So over here, this is the red version that we have.
01:24 There's really two files that we're going to have to work with
01:26 in terms of the HTML.
01:28 We have our _layout and our index.
01:32 This does the navigation in the main top level
01:35 design as we saw, and then the content gets dropped in here
01:38 and that's going to be that special homepage
01:40 or the details of the package.
01:43 Let's do a little bit of extra work
01:45 to make things easier on us.
01:47 So let's go over here and let's do some organization.
01:50 First of all, this is going to become a true nightmare.
01:52 So let's do some organization here.
02:05 So far CSS images and JSON, and we'll put these things
02:10 in their various places.
02:15 We have to update them over here.
02:16 It wouldn't be new, so instead of static
02:18 we now have static img.
02:26 Let's go and set the title here.
02:29 Python Package Index Demo.
02:33 And this one's going to be CSS.
02:35 Let's just make sure everything is still working.
02:38 Yeah, it looks exactly the same.
02:40 That's what we want, okay.
02:41 So a little organization, reorganization worked okay.
02:45 Let's go and add a couple of things here.
02:48 I'm going to add a CSS file, called Site.
02:53 We're also going to want add one called Home.
02:57 Now Home is only going to appear in the homepage.
02:59 It's just going to style like that big top banner
03:01 and then Site is going to appear on all of the pages.
03:04 So we'll just work with that one for now.
03:06 Let's make sure we include it.
03:11 There we have our site, and we can just do a quick test
03:13 to make sure that, that's working.
03:22 Refresh it, and it looks like
03:23 it had some effect, okay, great.
03:25 Put it back.
03:27 Alright, everything seems to be working.
