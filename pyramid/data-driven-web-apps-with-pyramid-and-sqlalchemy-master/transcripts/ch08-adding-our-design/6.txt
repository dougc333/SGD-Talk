00:00 So first two sites is lookin' great.
00:01 That part, not so much.
00:04 We want it to look like this, right here
00:06 with new releases, hot off the presses
00:07 and then a list formatted like so.
00:10 Alright, so first of all, it seems like I forgot
00:12 the little subtitle there, so let's put that in place.
00:17 So I want to have a little h2 and then a little subtitle.
00:23 Okay, get in there.
00:24 Those need some styling.
00:26 Alright, bolded, smaller, things like that.
00:28 But it's on the right path.
00:29 Come on down here.
00:31 Now if we look at this, it's going to be in the project list.
00:35 So we're going to use that along with h2, the subtitle
00:38 and the project pieces, just file that.
00:41 So do that again over here.
00:44 So the first thing let's target that h2
00:47 and set the font size to 24 pixels.
00:51 Font weight to bold, and the color to almost black
00:57 but not all the way.
01:00 Lookin' good, lookin' good.
01:03 Also our project list, and then we have
01:05 a little subtitle thing.
01:07 That was sort of italics there.
01:09 So we say font style, is that italic? Good guess.
01:14 Hot of the presses, that's in italics.
01:17 Okay great, the last thing to do
01:18 is to put these bits into those nice little boxes
01:22 and give 'em some spacing and borders and so on.
01:25 So these have just the project for the overall section
01:29 and there's a bunch of styles we want to set here.
01:31 I'll just paste those in.
01:34 So we're going to set the border.
01:37 Apparently I had that in there twice.
01:38 Set the border, the padding, and the background
01:40 the minimum height.
01:42 Set a margin at the top and bottom.
01:44 Let's see how that looks.
01:48 Oooh, looking much better, looking much better.
01:50 So the overall box, I think is ready.
01:52 That looks totally good.
01:54 And then the last thing to do
01:55 is to style those little pieces, right there.
01:58 So our project list.
02:00 Now this you can use just the starting characters here.
02:05 project.title.
02:08 In this one, we just want to set the font size to 20 pixels.
02:11 Make that a little bit bigger.
02:13 See how that affected it. Closer, closer.
02:19 While we're at it, let's go ahead and set that hyperlink
02:21 which is going to be project list.project.title
02:26 that contains the hyperlink.
02:28 I'm going to set it's color to be that value.
02:32 There we go. Startin' to look good.
02:34 Well, yeah just got to do a few more things
02:37 and then we're done. So project list.
02:44 The description, that's also italic, but not bold.
02:48 So we'll say normal. The font size is 16 pixels.
02:54 See how that description is comin' along.
02:57 Oh yeah, lookin' like what we're waiting for.
02:59 The last thing to do
03:01 actually I think the version looks okay.
03:03 The version is good.
03:05 So we're not pulling this data from anywhere
03:07 but we're more or less gettin' what we're after.
03:11 Excellent, let's do a quick run through.
03:14 Sure is lookin' really good.
03:16 This part is lookin' really good and this.
03:20 We still have the outer shell to build.
03:22 Right, we've got the navigation up in the top
03:25 and down at the bottom, we've got this footer thing.
03:28 So maybe we'll work on the navigation next.
03:31 But we are almost done with this page.
