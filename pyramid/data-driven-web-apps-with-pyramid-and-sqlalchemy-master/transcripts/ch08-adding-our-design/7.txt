00:00 The next thing that our site needs
00:01 is an overall navigation look and feel.
00:04 So here's our expected target
00:07 we got this little icon up here
00:09 and got those here, and then the bottom we have a footer
00:13 but our pages, we don't have any of that.
00:15 So, our goal this time is to add the navigation at the top.
00:20 Also, we're going to need this image and two others
00:23 so I'm going to copy those into our image location here.
00:28 You see we have like a blue cube
00:31 here's that logo and a white cube.
00:33 The blue and white cube are going to be
00:35 used in a minute, but we need
00:38 the logo one right now
00:40 so might as well get those files in place.
00:42 So the next thing that we need to do is
00:43 we're going to put a nav item right here.
00:47 And we saw the really nice dynamic behavior
00:51 a responsive design becoming a dropdown menu
00:54 and all that kind of stuff in Bootstrap.
00:58 And in order for that to work
00:59 we have to follow a very precise layout
01:01 with lots of pieces involved.
01:02 So, just because I'm sure I'll make a mistake
01:05 I'm going to copy this over.
01:06 I got it by copying it from the Bootstrap site
01:09 and I'll put it over here.
01:12 So here, let's do a little cleanup and look at this.
01:16 So we're going to have a nav bar
01:18 and normally these are whitish
01:20 but if you say inverse
01:21 it's darkish, usually black and gray.
01:24 And over here we're going to have what's called
01:27 the hamburger menu when it collapses, right.
01:29 This is the toggle bit.
01:32 Here is that logo and then in this part
01:35 we're going to put as many items as we want
01:38 so I'll put three for now.
01:40 Let's look and see what we got.
01:43 It's probably not going to look good. Let's see.
01:46 Ooh, that looks better than I expected.
01:49 Remember when I did the theme overrides
01:51 it took some of these and put them in there.
01:54 Still need to do a little work
01:55 to get these items down and over
01:57 and of course to get help
01:59 donate, log in, and register
02:00 so we can do that really easy.
02:11 There, now we have the actual items.
02:13 Let's put a little bit of style in place
02:15 to make sure that those go down and over
02:17 like they're supposed to.
02:18 So down here for the navigation
02:19 let me just pace this
02:20 so you don't have to watch me type out.
02:22 So the image we're going to set to be a certain size
02:25 we set the width to be fixed
02:27 and that automatically scales the height
02:28 and we also push it over a little bit.
02:31 We take and set the margin a little bit higher.
02:34 And then these items, we're going to push them down.
02:37 That's only part of the solution
02:38 but let's see what we got.
02:40 Looking better, right?
02:41 This is looking really good.
02:43 But notice this is pushed
02:45 into the left a little more than this
02:47 so we need to do one more thing.
02:50 I want to target this register
02:52 so I'm going to give it an id
02:54 of Last, Nav, Link.
02:57 So I can push that one to the right.
03:00 For IDs, you'd say hash, so it'd say Last Nav Link
03:04 margin right, 50px might be decent.
03:10 There we go, cycle back and forth.
03:12 Eh, close enough, let's say 45.
03:16 Ooh pretty close, I'm going to call that close enough.
03:18 It doesn't actually matter just as long as
03:20 it has basically has the look and feel, right?
03:23 Now, let's see if we have any
03:24 responsive design behavior here.
03:26 Oh yeah, look at that.
03:28 How awesome is that? Bootstrap is really cool, isn't it?
03:32 How 'about that?
03:33 We got our navigation bits in place.
03:36 Now, remember, we do have other pages.
03:40 Here we go, we have our about and we have our home.
03:43 So if we go back and forth, notice
03:44 it's already taken that design
03:48 back and forth as we go here
03:49 so that's really, really great.
