00:00 With our connection and engine set up
00:02 it's time to create the tables.
00:04 One way the wrong way
00:06 would be to go to the database
00:08 and actually start using the database design
00:11 and modeling tools to just go and model the stuff.
00:14 Because we've already got that right here.
00:17 In fact, we need those to match exactly.
00:20 So it's better if we just let SQLAlchemy do it.
00:22 So, it's actually super easy here.
00:25 Let's go down after we've done this bit
00:28 and if we can import our SQLAlchemyBase
00:33 which we can, it has metadata right there.
00:37 And on the metadata
00:38 there's no help from PyCharm here
00:40 but it does exist when we say, create_all
00:42 and pass the engine.
00:44 So, if the database doesn't exist
00:46 whatever connection string info we gave it here
00:49 it will create it
00:51 and then it's going to create the tables
00:53 and the primary keys and the relationships
00:56 and all that stuff
00:57 based on all of the various types that derive from this.
01:01 There's one really big caveat that's easy to miss here.
01:05 By the time line 27 is run
01:08 every single class that derives from it
01:11 must have already been imported, so SQLAlchemy has seen it.
01:16 If you import those afterwards, too late
01:19 those tables are not getting created.
01:21 So I'm pretty sure right now, the way this is working
01:24 is it's going to be failing
01:27 So we need to do something kind of like this.
01:30 We need to go over here and say
01:31 from pypi.data.packages
01:35 import package, release
01:39 and user, and whatever.
01:42 Alright, so we got to do this for all of 'em.
01:44 So we got to do it like this.
01:45 Now that, expanding out of all the ones you need
01:48 turns out to be super error prone
01:50 so let's add one little trick here.
01:53 And add one more file.
01:54 Now let's call this all_models
01:57 kay, and over here I'll say, well exactly that.
02:06 So we're just going to list everyone here
02:08 from packages, import package
02:09 and we define release and we're going to import that
02:10 and we define languages, we're going to import that
02:12 and let's tell PyCharm
02:14 "Hold on, no this, I know it looks like this does nothing,"
02:17 "but for the moment, we need to have this here."
02:20 "It actually has an effect that you don't realize."
02:22 "So thanks for the help, but not this time."
02:24 And then over here, we can just make this a little simpler.
02:29 We can just import it like
02:32 that, and we'll put that little, you know
02:35 "PyCharm, please ignore this."
02:37 So that way, we can just model it right here
02:39 and it doesn't matter where
02:41 where we do this import
02:42 but that's a really not obvious thing
02:44 but you have to basically, before you run this
02:46 import every single model
02:48 or it's not going to work.
02:49 However, with this in place
02:51 and if we call this function, it should work.
02:53 So let's go to our __init__ down here
02:57 we're going to include the net routing
02:59 let's have a init DB config.
03:05 And we'll come down here and we'll just put that at the end.
03:09 And this should be pretty simple
03:10 so we'll say, "DB session,"
03:13 import that
03:14 and we'll just say, "global_init,"
03:16 and we'll have to give it a file.
03:17 What file do we give it?
03:19 Well, let's make a little folder
03:21 'cause this is SQLite, we'll just make a little folder
03:24 called DB and we'll put it in here, okay?
03:27 If we were using, say PostCraft, like I said
03:29 that we'd just give it a regular connection string
03:31 like here's the server.
03:32 But we're going to need this, so how do we do that?
03:35 Let's say, "DB folder."
03:39 We'll use the os module, yeah?
03:41 So come over here and say, "path.absolutepath"
03:45 "of some stuff, we're going to say, os.path.join"
03:49 And what are we going to put in it?
03:50 We'll say, "os.path.dirname of wherever we are."
03:55 So, we're going to be in the PyPI folder just __init__.
04:01 So we want to be in the PyPI directory
04:03 and then down here, we're going to say
04:05 "The next thing we want is DB."
04:08 And then the next thing we want is pypi.bin
04:11 or let's call SQLite, how's that?
04:15 Want that right there.
04:18 And we'll just pass DB
04:20 let's call that file.
04:22 'Cause it's not just the folder, but it's the file.
04:26 Great, now if we run it
04:29 we're not using the config for now
04:30 so let's put an underscore
04:31 probably need it later if we say
04:33 "Store different DB settings in production"
04:36 "and development" here.
04:38 But now we don't need it.
04:39 Alright, so when we run this
04:41 we should see it print out a path that's located here
04:45 and actually create the database files.
04:47 You'll notice there's no little expando
04:49 chevron thing here.
04:50 There's no files in there.
04:51 Let's run it.
04:54 Well it didn't crash, that's a good start.
04:57 It's creating this, you can see way down there.
05:00 Now, if I go over here
05:04 say "Synchronize."
05:06 Oh look, look look look what we got!
05:08 How cool is that?
05:10 Okay, so, it's really nice that this is here
05:12 how do we know what's in it?
05:13 Did it actually create that packages table
05:16 or did it not?
05:17 Well, in PyCharm that's easy to answer.
05:20 So we come over here and we can drag and drop this
05:24 and it'll open up if, if if if
05:26 it's a big if.
05:27 So you got to go here once on your machine
05:29 and go "datasource SQLite serial"
05:32 and then notice here it has driver.
05:36 It looks like it can update the driver files
05:38 but sometimes it'll say you have to download
05:41 the driver files 'cause there's no file.
05:42 So we can download 'em again
05:45 just to show you what that looks like.
05:48 Alright, apparently that's updated.
05:49 That's cool.
05:51 We can come down here and expand this out in the schema
05:54 and main and look!
05:55 There's our packages.
05:56 Primary key with an index ID.
05:58 Right, there's that.
06:00 We got a create date, which is a datetime.
06:02 Our summary which is varchar.
06:03 Our license which is varchar.
06:05 There's a lot of varchar happenin' around here.
06:07 But there is our database with our one table
06:10 and notice it's named packages plural
06:12 not upper case P package singular.
06:15 You go over here, say "Select,"
06:18 "star from Packages where author email"
06:22 look at that, beautiful.
06:23 Beautiful beautiful.
06:25 If for some reason you don't have the pro version
06:26 of PyCharm
06:28 you can use this app DB Browser for SQLite.
06:35 Come over here and find the file.
06:41 And you get the same thing, right?
06:42 So here you go, it's not.
06:44 I dunno, maybe it's nicer or maybe it's not quite as nice.
06:46 I haven't used it that much
06:47 but this is also another thing you can get for free.
06:50 Just google DB Browser for SQLite.
06:52 Either way, our database is all up and running.
06:56 Now this is only the beginning of course
06:58 but we've created our database
07:00 and we've got a lot of stuff in place.
07:02 Really all we have left to do
07:04 is just to expand out all the other various tables
07:07 we're going to work with.
