00:00 When you choose a framework
00:01 whether that's for a database or web framework
00:03 it's good to know that you're in good company
00:05 that other companies and products have already tested this
00:09 and looked around and decided
00:11 yeah, SQLAlchemy is a great choice.
00:13 So let's look at some of the popular deployments.
00:17 Dropbox is a user of SQLAlchemy and Dropbox is
00:20 one of the most significant Python shops out there.
00:25 Guido van Rossum and some of the other
00:27 core developers work there
00:28 and almost everything they do is in Python
00:31 so the fact that they use SQLAlchemy
00:32 that's a very high vote of confidence.
00:36 Uber, Uber uses SQLAlchemy.
00:38 Reddit, Reddit's interesting in that
00:40 they don't use the ORM, but in fact they use only the core
00:45 at least a while ago they were using only the core aspect
00:49 of SQLAlchemy, that's pretty cool.
00:52 Firefox, Mozilla, more properly, is using SQLAlchemy.
00:57 OpenStack makes heavy use of SQLAlchemy.
01:00 FreshBooks, the accounting software
01:02 based on, you guessed it, SQLAlchemy.
01:04 We've got Hulu, Yelp, TriMet
01:08 that's the Public Transit Authority
01:10 for all of Portland, Oregon
01:11 the trains, the buses and things like that
01:15 so they use that as well.
01:16 So here are just a couple of the companies
01:18 and products that use SQLAlchemy.
01:20 There's some really high pressure, some of these are under
01:23 you know if it's working for them
01:25 it's going to work well for you, especially Reddit
01:27 Reddit gets a crazy amount of traffic.
01:30 So pretty interesting that they're all using it
01:32 and we'll see why in a little bit.
