00:00 Well, we had everything working, seemed like.
00:03 Come over here and all the queries are running.
00:05 There's no data, in fact, even if we go over here
00:07 and we refresh, we now have our packages
00:10 and their indexes, but again, if we try to look, no records.
00:15 So, everything looks like it's fine.
00:17 Actually, here's our six users.
00:18 That's pretty sweet, must have been playing with that.
00:21 In fact, I know exactly where those
00:23 six users are coming from.
00:24 Let's get rid of that. Remember this?
00:29 Yeah, let's drop that.
00:31 So, it even looks like our little count thing
00:33 is actually working, 'cause
00:34 apparently we've run this six times now.
00:37 Okay, so, here's the problem, if I try to login
00:41 it crashes, and it says hash code has kind of gone
00:44 insane, well, what is going on here?
00:48 We're trying to hash like a string, or some...
00:50 Let's go, let's go get, let's go figure this out.
00:57 We can even set a break point here and see what's going on.
01:01 Try to login again, our user object comes along
01:04 our user hashed_password is ... not set.
01:07 It's 'cause we haven't actually logged in, right?
01:09 So there's this sort of messed up data
01:11 let's go ahead and just clear that out.
01:14 Now if we go try to login, it says the user wasn't found.
01:18 So, that's good, hey great, that just must mean
01:21 we need to register, so let's go register.
01:25 Here's where we're going to run into the mismatch between the data types.
01:28 None type is callable, oh, maybe not yet.
01:31 Our user_service, find_user_by_id, apparently
01:33 we didn't rewrite that one, did we?
01:35 No, we're looking straight at it .
01:37 Alright, let's fix that.
01:42 Not terribly hard to fix, is it?
01:44 Try again. Now, check this out, we were able
01:47 to register, and then we redirected
01:50 to account, see this is not account/register
01:52 it did that get post redirect success.
01:56 However, here's the data type mis-match.
01:58 It said, look, you can't pass me zero
02:02 an integer, when I expected an ObjectId.
02:05 It has to be this weird, sort of
02:07 UUID format for ObjectIds.
02:09 And we can fix that really easy.
02:11 If we go over to our cookie auth
02:12 you'll see we're passing integers
02:14 but we don't want to pass integers
02:15 'cause that's not what the id is anymore.
02:17 It's now this thing called bson
02:18 which comes from the dependency
02:20 we installed, and an ObjectId.
02:23 So, we're going to turn that to a string
02:25 this is fine, nothing major happened there.
02:27 Here is where we get the mistake.
02:30 We're returning an integer, and we want to return this.
02:32 So instead of doing this, try int thing
02:35 we're going to say try return bson.ObjectId
02:38 of user ID, except ... return none.
02:43 K, so, we have to convert this
02:45 from a string to this ObjectId class
02:48 it knows how to parse it's own strings
02:49 it's fine, but we can't do it as
02:51 an integer, it's not an integer.
02:53 Okay, now we should be able to use the site.
02:57 Look at that, our account is here!
02:58 Michael Kennedy, we can go home.
03:00 We can see we have one user.
03:02 Let's logout and create one more
03:03 do this whole path successfully.
03:05 Register ... Sarah Smith ... ss@gmail.com
03:09 and ... she just likes the letter s.
03:12 Boom, looks like she logged in fine.
03:14 Our ... formatting here isn't amazing, but ...
03:17 That's fine, we're just going to leave it.
03:19 So, now we've got this entirely working
03:21 with MongoDB, and we come over here
03:23 and we can go look at our users
03:26 here we can see this one with a massive
03:28 crazy, hashed_password, same thing
03:30 for Sarah Smith, with her massive password
03:33 over here, right, we can scroll way over.
03:35 That's a serious password.
03:37 It's pretty sweet, it looks like we've
03:38 converted successfully from SQLAlchemy over to MongoDB.
03:43 Hopefully you felt like wow we didn't
03:44 really do that much, I mean, I talked a lot
03:46 to help you understand some of the new concepts
03:49 but if I didn't talk that much
03:50 we could have cranked that out really quick.
03:52 Because we add the new entities
03:54 rewrite the services, we're kind of there.
