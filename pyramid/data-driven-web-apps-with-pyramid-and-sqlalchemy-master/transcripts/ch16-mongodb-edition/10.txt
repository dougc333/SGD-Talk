00:00 Let me just make a one final comment here
00:02 on cleanup before we finish with this whole chapter.
00:05 We won't write anymore code.
00:06 Just think about some ideas here.
00:09 Now that we've migrated all of our data over to MongoDB
00:12 if we're truly committed to moving away
00:15 from our relational database and over to Mongo
00:18 or whatever direction you're going.
00:19 It doesn't really matter. The same thinking applies.
00:22 If you're fully committed to being over into that new space
00:25 we've moved our data
00:27 well, the next step would be to go over here
00:30 hit delete, just wipe away all those files.
00:33 Commit that to GitHub.
00:35 Maybe tag it or somehow like create some kind of branch
00:38 or do something to make a really clear spot
00:40 that you can go back and find it.
00:42 But then remove it.
00:44 Don't keep these things hanging around
00:46 because you'll have to somehow maintain them.
00:49 You know, the way it works when you do the scan
00:51 for the routes is it's going to read through all these
00:54 and then these are going to see things
00:55 like the top import SQLAlchemy.
00:57 You'll still have to install those dependencies
01:00 even though you have no intention of using them.
01:01 So wipe that away, delete that file
01:05 'cause same reason that I just described.
01:08 It's going to have the SQLAlchemy dependencies
01:10 and it's going to cause trouble.
01:11 We're not doing that 'cause I want to leave it
01:13 in this state where you can come to this
01:16 look at this migration.
01:17 You can take the data that is being shipped through GitHub
01:22 here and then run this migrate to Mongo
01:25 to actually get the data into MongoDB
01:27 because I'm not shipping the MongoDB database separately.
01:30 It's not so easy.
01:31 So anyway, I think I'm going to keep it for your demo
01:35 for your example to be around.
01:37 However, in practice, once you've made this transformation
01:42 it's time to, you know, put a save point in GitHub
01:46 wave goodby to whatever the other data model was
01:48 and move on.
01:49 If you need it back, there's always source control.
01:51 You can get it back.
