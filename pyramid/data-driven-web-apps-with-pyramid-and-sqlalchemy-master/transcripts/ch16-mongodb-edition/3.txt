00:00 I did say that we're not going to make this
00:01 a full MongoDB course, but I want to give you just enough
00:04 of a foundation of how these things work
00:06 so you can sort of appreciate what we're doing.
00:09 So the way we model data in document databases
00:11 is very different than relational databases.
00:13 Relational databases, we have, say, packages
00:16 and we have users and we have a maintainer's table
00:19 which is a normalization table between them
00:21 things like that.
00:22 In document databases, it's much closer
00:24 to actually being the same shape and style
00:27 as you have in memory, hierarchical
00:29 as you do in the database.
00:30 So, for example, here is a chapter
00:32 from one of my courses in MongoDB.
00:36 The green stuff here is the same as you would have
00:39 in SQLte, Postgres, whatever, right?
00:42 It's just straight columns.
00:44 But notice those lectures.
00:45 These are, that's an array in JavaScript
00:47 and then that's an embedded series of objects.
00:50 So these are embedded in here, and you can think of this
00:52 as like a pre-computed join
00:54 one of the reasons these databases can be so fast.
00:57 So the big question is
00:58 can you actually query deeply down into here?
01:00 Can you still answer the question?
01:02 What chapter has lecture 10106
01:06 and could I get it back?
01:07 Luckily, you can, and you can do that with an index
01:09 and can be incredibly fast.
01:11 So we're going to ask and answer questions like that
01:13 throughout this chapter.
