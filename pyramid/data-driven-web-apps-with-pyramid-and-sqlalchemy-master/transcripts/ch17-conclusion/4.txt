00:01 to say thank you.
00:02 Thank you for taking this course
00:04 thank you for supporting my work
00:06 and I hope you really appreciate what you got out
00:08 of it, and I hope it was valuable and useful for you.
00:12 If you do build a cool web app and you publish
00:15 it on the internet, well I'll definitely share
00:16 it with everybody that follows me
00:17 on the various social networks and whatnot.
00:20 Thank you, thank you, thank you
