00:00 Now, I suspect you're probably very familiar
00:02 with the GitHub repository, but before
00:04 we move along, just remember, if you haven't
00:07 starred this, maybe even forked it, you probably should.
00:11 That'll help you keep track of it
00:12 and keep your own version exactly like
00:14 it was at the end of this course.
00:16 If you don't use Git, you could just come over here
00:18 and just download it as a ZIP.
00:20 So we already have all of our data
00:23 and this is what the data importer uses.
00:25 And the source, and we have the before
00:27 and after code for many of the various changes.
00:30 So for example, validation, this is where we started.
00:33 This is where we finished.
00:35 If at any point you want to jump in and go awe
00:36 I want to go from here to there
00:38 hopefully the structure here will make that really easy
00:42 instead of just having, here's the final code
00:44 at the end, good luck on how it was in the middle.
00:46 So I really tried to save for each chapter
00:49 a beginning and an end along the way
00:51 so it would really help you be able to jump
00:53 in and out and see what we built at each step.
