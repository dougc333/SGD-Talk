00:00 We've gone through several rounds
00:01 of reorganizing our code in our pyramid web application.
00:05 And it may be sometimes hard to see the value in this
00:09 but as your app grows and grows the better organized it is
00:14 the less weight you get put onto you
00:18 conceptually to try to keep all that in your head.
00:21 So really important organization, makes a lot of sense.
00:24 We saw that we did this with the templates
00:26 we did this with controllers
00:27 we did this with the view models.
00:30 Guess what? We're going to do it with tests as well.
00:32 And because the tests usually have to do with either
00:36 a URL, the view model or the view method
00:40 these are all grouped into controllers so far.
00:43 So, it makes sense to go ahead and group them by controller.
00:46 So, it doesn't have to be this way
00:49 but it certainly seems like a decent way to get started
00:52 and you can do additional organizing if you want.
00:55 So we also have a HomeController and a PackageController
00:59 so we have their respective tests as well.
01:01 We didn't write any for the CMS stuff yet so none of those.
01:05 Now, another thing that's really helpful is if we have a site map in.
01:10 We'll talk about this at the end of this chapter
01:13 having a site map. Which is basically just a XML document that lists
01:18 all of the publicly accessible URLs on your site
01:22 even if they're not directly linked
01:23 so that things like Google and Bing can find
01:25 and search your site.
01:27 We could leverage that site map to cover a bunch of cases.
01:31 You'd be really surprised how often you get hard failures
01:35 instead of what you might consider a soft failure
01:37 if something goes wrong.
01:39 If I request the package page but for some reason
01:41 the package query is wrong?
01:43 Probably I'm going to get just nothing back
01:45 in which case the template is going to crash
01:47 or something else is going to crash because
01:49 the None type doesn't have whatever they're trying to do.
01:52 So, simply requesting every page on your site
01:55 and just checking that those come back with success codes
01:58 and not failure codes?
01:59 That's really actually pretty valuable.
02:02 You can test a lot of semi important
02:04 not super important things that way.
02:07 All right, so we'll talk about that as well
02:09 but we're going to focus on testing the internal logic
02:12 of these various controllers, view models and so on.
02:14 And here's an organization that will help us
02:17 keep that all straight and clean.
