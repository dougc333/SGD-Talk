00:00 Our web app is basically built.
00:02 All we have left to do is test and deploy it.
00:05 So, let's talk about testing web applications.
00:08 Now, this is not a chapter on unit testing
00:11 and all of its benefits in general.
00:14 The goal is to focus on testing web applications,
00:17 addressing some of the challenges that we'll see
00:19 that can be hard, of working with web apps,
00:21 in terms of testing, for example,
00:24 how do we, like, set up the web framework around it
00:26 if it depends upon things like pyramids request object.
00:30 And what are some of the techniques we can use
00:32 to take advantage of stuff the web app
00:34 already provides us, like, the URL structure, and so on.
00:38 Let's begin by asking the question, "Why test?"
00:42 Why should we write tests at all?
00:44 Well, your first response is probably,
00:45 "So that we can find our bugs, there are surely
00:48 "bugs in our web app, let's make sure
00:50 "we find them and then get rid of them."
00:52 And that is great, but that's not
00:53 the only reason to write tests.
00:56 These days in modern software development,
00:57 we have a lot of infrastructure in place
01:00 to help with things like continuous deployment,
01:02 and checking code, and verifying that we don't
01:05 step on each other's feet if we're working on a team,
01:07 things like that, and testing for Python web apps
01:10 is really one of the few verifications
01:13 that we have that we can work with.
01:15 Let's suppose that we have continuous integration,
01:18 which is a system like TeamCity or Travis CI
01:21 that looks at our GitHub repository, watches a branch,
01:23 watches for PRs, and when a change comes in,
01:26 it will automatically check it out
01:28 and build our project, and that build
01:30 probably includes running tests, but if we don't have tests,
01:34 that build passing, what does it mean?
01:35 I actually don't know what it means
01:37 in terms of Python, maybe we could
01:38 install the dependencies, register the website?
01:41 That might be about it, because Python doesn't
01:44 even have compiling, so this testing in place means that
01:48 when our automatic builds pass, that actually says something
01:51 about the state of our web app.
01:53 If we want to go farther, and go with continuous
01:55 delivery and automatic deploy our site
01:58 when we put it onto a branch and the build passes,
02:01 then really need some sort of verification with our test.
02:03 So these tests are important foundational items
02:06 for many things that we might do around our project.
