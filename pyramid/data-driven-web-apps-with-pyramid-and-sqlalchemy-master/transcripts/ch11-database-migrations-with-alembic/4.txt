00:00 So we're able to add that change to that column.
00:03 We also added our auditing table, but I commented it out
00:06 so, Alembic wouldn't notice those changes.
00:09 So now let's go over here and we can have it do
00:12 another change. So I'm going to say generate another upgrade
00:17 and this upgrade is going to be adding auditing.
00:24 Now it goes and runs again and says oh, this time we
00:27 are going to create a new table and that table's going
00:29 to have a special index on created date.
00:32 Cool, huh. So let's see what else we got.
00:34 We now have two pieces and this one says
00:37 here's the revision and it derives from it depends
00:41 upon this previous one.
00:42 So this is how they chain together.
00:44 We're going to upgrade.
00:45 It's going to go create the table in the primary key
00:49 and all that. Then it's going to create the index and of course
00:51 dropping that in reverse is what's going to happen
00:53 if we undo it. So let's go and run this.
01:00 Let's get this database updated to the current version.
01:03 Again alembic upgrade head.
01:05 This time it's going to upgrade from this version
01:08 do as many steps as necessary, to that version
01:12 by adding auditing. Now again, what do we get?
01:15 We now have an auditing table, beautiful.
01:18 Granted that auditing table could have been added by
01:20 SQLAlchemy, but suppose that auditing table was defining
01:26 a foreign key and maintainers that linked back to it.
01:28 It wouldn't be all put together correctly.
01:31 Here's how we can use Alembic to manage the structure
01:34 of our database.
01:36 What's really nice is we can use the Auto Generate feature
01:39 here to actually keep it in sync with whatever's happening
01:44 on our database.
01:47 Let's do one more quick thing to round out this lecture.
01:50 At the beginning we asked alembic current to see
01:52 what the version was and it kind of did a no op
01:54 and so that meant there was no version.
01:56 Now we can say alembic current and it will actually
01:59 tell us this is the current version of the database
02:02 and that's the latest as far as Alembic's concerned.
02:04 Double check the state of any database by asking Alembic
02:08 about Current.
02:09 Also in the slides I'm going to talk about this
02:12 alembic_helpers and so I'm dropping this in here
02:15 so you have it. If you want to use the operations that I talk about
02:19 in a moment, but they're not actually used in the demo.
02:22 I'm just including this here for the manual side of things.
02:26 Maybe it will even be helpful in the auto generated
02:29 steps as well. It's especially helpful in the manual bits.
02:33 I'll just throw that in there just so you have it.
