00:00 Let's take a moment and review
00:01 the core concepts of using Alembic
00:03 and I think the place to get started is getting started.
00:06 The way we're going to get started is we have to make sure
00:08 we have Alembic. We simply get that by pip install alembic
00:12 make sure this is the virtual environment
00:14 that you want it to be in, okay?
00:16 So that works great; let's go install
00:19 then we need to initialize the project structure
00:21 just once, so we say, alembic init alembic
00:24 first one is a command, last one is the folder
00:27 and then it's going to go through and create all the structure
00:29 and says don't forget you have to set your connection string
00:31 in Alembic.ini or this isn't going to work.
00:35 Afterwards, you have a project that looks a little bit different;
00:38 you've got an Alembic folder and here we have versions.
00:42 They're going to be initially empty but as you apply
00:44 as you create revisions they're going to be stored in here
00:47 and chained together as we saw.
00:49 Some scripts that are used to generate the SQL
00:54 and run Alembic so environment does things like tells Alembic
00:59 what your sqlalchemy models are
01:01 the script.py.mako is actually going to generate
01:05 the SQL structure that's going to be sent to the database
01:08 things like that. And finally, we have our Alembic.ini
01:12 that configures how Alembic runs.
01:14 In order to use Alembic, you have to configure it
01:17 so there's a whole bunch of settings in Alembic.ini
01:20 but the one that you probably care about first
01:22 is sqlalchemy.url and then you just set it
01:25 to whatever your connection string is.
01:27 We're using SQLite so it's sqlite:/// the name of the file
01:31 and we're able to use a relative path
01:33 I think this may only work
01:34 if you run Alembic from the right location
01:37 so do that. Turns out that's pretty easy from PyCharm
01:41 cuz the terminal always opens in the right place.
