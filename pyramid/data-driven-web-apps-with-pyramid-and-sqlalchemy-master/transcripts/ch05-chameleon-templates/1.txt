00:00 When we created our project
00:01 our website with Cookiecutter
00:03 you saw it ask a question.
00:05 What template language would you like to use?
00:07 Would you like to use Jinja2, Chameleon, or Mako?
00:10 So let's look at these three template languages
00:13 all of which are totally viable choices for our web app
00:17 and compare them and sort of see what the trade-offs are
00:19 why you might choose one over the other and so on.
00:23 So like I said there's these three options.
00:25 We have Jinja2 and I would say really
00:27 this is the most popular one of these.
00:31 It's very much the default for Flask
00:34 and now it is also become the default for Pyramid.
00:38 So being the default means most people pick that
00:41 and I believe Flask
00:43 this is the only one that ships with it.
00:45 So that really tilts the scale in it's favor if you will.
00:48 There's also Mako.
00:49 This is probably the least popular.
00:51 This is the one I've seen the least of I guess
00:53 but maybe I'm just not looking in the right places.
00:56 But Mako and Jinja2 are pretty similar.
00:58 And then Chameleon
00:59 we've looked at Chameleon.
01:01 And below you see the three packages that you have to install
01:04 only one at a time
01:05 for enabling that language in your web app.
01:08 So pyramid_jinja2, pyramid_mako, or pyramid_chameleon.
01:14 And if you pick the various options
01:16 in that Cookiecutter template
01:17 it will choose for you.
