00:00 Saw the one job of these view models
00:03 and that's to do the data exchange.
00:04 The other is validation.
00:06 So, let's look at that now.
00:08 Here we have our gathering of data, right.
00:12 We're creating this view model based on a request
00:14 and it's populating even normalizing some of our data
00:17 like first name, last name, and email.
00:19 Great but on the POST side of things
00:22 where we're taking this data in
00:24 and we're doing a operation based on
00:26 assuming that we have good data
00:28 like that they actually set the name
00:29 they set the email and so on.
00:31 We want to do validation.
00:33 So that's where this error thing comes in.
00:36 So we're going to do this validate
00:38 and we're going to say check the first name or last name
00:41 and if either of them are empty
00:42 we'll say you must specify your full name.
00:45 If there's no email you must specify an email address.
00:48 If you don't specify a password similarly
00:51 you get a message that says that.
00:54 So, we set these errors and then the
00:56 action method or the view method
00:58 its job will be to make sure that there's no errors
01:01 before it actually does its operation.
01:04 We can even do things that interact with the database.
01:08 So, here this is a registration operation.
01:10 We did basic validation on the form values.
01:13 First name, last name exist and are not empty.
01:16 Email is set, we could do regular expression
01:19 to say this is a valid email
01:20 or something simpler like check for @ and .
01:24 A few things like that.
01:25 But here we're actually going alright
01:27 once you pass all the basic validation
01:29 let's go to the database and see if there
01:31 is a user with the email address
01:33 that you're trying to register as
01:35 because if there is we're not going to let you do that.
01:38 The user already exists, right.
01:40 So, we have these sort of basic validation
01:42 and higher level validation we can do.
