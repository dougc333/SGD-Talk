00:00 Let's begin our exploration of Bootstrap by installing it
00:03 and just seeing what effect that has.
00:04 It's actually kind of remarkable.
00:06 So if we come over here, we now have
00:09 a Chapter 7 Bootstrap, and again
00:11 we have the starter and the final code.
00:13 The starter code is what we're starting with
00:15 and then the final code actually, is a copy
00:17 of starter right now, but will, of course
00:19 evolve into whatever we do during this part.
00:22 So we're going to break this into two sections.
00:24 We're going to play with basic HTML, CSS, things like that.
00:29 So we're going to do a little bit of bare HTML
00:31 some stuff with grids, and so on
00:33 and then we're going to go back to PyCharm, back to Pyramid
00:36 and apply that in a major way to our web app.
00:40 So, let's begin at looking at what I consider
00:42 kind of a scary page.
00:44 Not scary in the sense that the HTML is complicated.
00:47 In fact, it's as simple as it can be.
00:50 We have head, we have a title, we have a body
00:52 we have an h1, and a couple of paragraphs.
00:54 That's simple, right?
00:56 It's scary in the sense that
00:58 it's a blank slate to start from and design.
01:01 Everything has to be done.
01:02 You have to figure out the line spacing, the fonts
01:05 the colors, the color balance
01:07 the background colors, everything.
01:11 Everything you want to do, layout systems, right?
01:14 If you're going to do some some kind of grid layout.
01:16 Don't use tables by the way, that's not so good
01:18 unless it's tabular data of course.
01:20 But, to me, this looks, anyway it's hard to read
01:23 it's kind of icky. So we can do one super simple thing to get started here
01:27 that's going to make it nicer.
01:28 So let's just open this in PyCharm.
01:32 Remember file open directory on the other OS's.
01:37 Alright, here we are inside PyCharm.
01:39 As you can see from what view source was
01:41 yeah it's a simple little html page.
01:44 But what we can do is we can simply add a reference
01:48 import through style sheet Bootstrap.
01:52 So, for the moment, I'm going to use the Bootstrap CDN
01:55 I prefer to install it locally, but let's just drop
01:58 this one in here and we're using Bootstrap 3
02:03 Bootstrap 4 has been released at this point
02:05 but all the templates that Pyramid uses
02:07 and all the Cookiecutter stuff even outside
02:10 of what Pyramid does uses
02:11 to generate these sites is in Bootstrap 3.
02:14 So, here's the trade off I'm making
02:17 we could use Bootstrap 4 and talk about that
02:19 but that would mean every, well not every bit
02:22 much of the existing website would stop working
02:25 the navigation and what not, so we'd have to unravel that.
02:31 And this way, we can just build on what
02:32 the scaffolding is generating for us.
02:34 I decided less effort, less confusion, let's just
02:38 go with Bootstrap 3 for now.
02:39 If you want to upgrade to 4, that's fine
02:41 they're incompatible, so just be aware.
02:43 A lot of things about them operate differently.
02:46 It matters whether this is 3 or 4
02:48 but we're going to use 3 for now.
02:51 Alright, with this simple change, let's go back here
02:54 and I'm going to duplicate this tab
02:56 so that we have them side-by-side.
02:59 Check this out, look how much nicer
03:01 and more legible that is.
03:04 Old, new, old, new.
03:09 Bootstrap has default values for fonts, spacing, padding
03:13 colors, notice even the color of the fonts, it's a little
03:16 bit different and it's just, it's just nicer.
03:19 So just the act of putting Bootstrap here
03:21 makes our site look better.
03:23 It also has another really important purpose.
03:25 Bootstrap functions as what's called a reset CSS.
03:29 You may have heard that it's hard to write
03:32 code for the web because on different browsers
03:35 things appear differently.
03:36 Now, sometimes that's just true incompatibilities
03:39 in the browser, but a lot of times that is
03:41 browsers making different assumptions about what a
03:45 non-styled element should do.
03:48 What should the padding be on a non-styled text input?
03:51 I don't know.
03:52 But if you don't explicitly set it, it's up to the
03:54 browser to go, "I think it's this."
03:57 And sometimes those assumptions or those defaults are
04:00 different or incompatible and that can be really annoying.
04:04 So what reset CSS's do is they explicitly set every possible
04:09 style of every possible element.
04:12 That means browsers no longer get to guess
04:14 and there's more consistency.
04:15 So you get that sort of easier to design for the web
04:18 also by dropping Bootstrap in here.
04:21 That's how we get started, nice and easy.
04:23 And it's already having a positive effect
04:25 on what we're doing.
