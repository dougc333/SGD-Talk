00:00 Two quick parting thoughts.
00:01 One, thee lorem ipsum, the filler text that I put here
00:06 is not standard for ipsum, it's what's called
00:09 hipster ipsum, so if you just search for hipster ipsum
00:13 you know ipsum like that and hipster
00:16 you'll get a slightly more entertaining filler text here.
00:19 So we have like Etsy, bicycle rides, Kickstarter
00:22 gentrify, Buschwick, Brunch Craft Beer, and so on.
00:26 It's kind of fun to play with.
00:27 So you can go and generate paragraphs of text there.
00:31 And also, even though this is not a python site
00:34 sometimes you need to run the html page
00:38 in the browser to get it to work right.
00:40 What we're doing, that's not true
00:41 but in PyCharm, even on plain html pages
00:45 and come over here and say run and it opens
00:48 over here like this.
00:50 The reason it looks a little bit different than that one
00:51 is I have this one zoomed like that
00:54 so you can see the differences a little more clearly.
00:56 There you go, so now you can see it's actually
00:57 running in a proper web server.
00:59 Sometimes that matters for JavaScript and things like that.
