00:00 The next thing we want to do is create a form with a button.
00:03 Maybe some hyperlinks with buttons as well.
00:05 So we'll just create a new HTML page here called "Buttons."
00:10 So we'll start by Bootstrappifying this.
00:13 Of course this goes in your standard and layout page
00:16 and your normal pages don't have to
00:18 to this, it just falls into place.
00:19 But for these little one-offs, it has to be done separately.
00:23 So let's imagine over here that we have a form.
00:26 Its action is just going to be nothing.
00:28 We'll just leave it like that for the minute.
00:30 And its method equals POST.
00:34 And in here, we want to have maybe something
00:36 for your email and your password
00:38 and let's say it's login, okay?
00:41 So, we'll come in here and we'll have
00:42 an input, type equals text and we'll
00:46 say placeholder equals email
00:49 we'll say it's required.
00:51 That's decent.
00:53 Actually, let's hold off on this just for a second.
00:55 Let's see it in its raw form here.
00:58 And let's have another input.
01:02 Make that password, placeholder
01:05 that's password also required.
01:09 And let's have a button, and I'll type equals
01:13 submit and I'll say login.
01:18 And maybe next to this button
01:19 we want to have a hyperlink.
01:23 Where for some reason, if you don't have an account
01:25 we can take you over to the register.
01:28 Okay, if we open that up
01:32 it looks very bad, very bad.
01:35 That looks super old school, doesn't it?
01:38 And of course it's going to look slightly different
01:40 in the different browsers.
01:42 So here's our email, here's our password.
01:45 The placeholders things are working.
01:47 The required thing is working.
01:49 Register works, but of course there's no file there.
01:53 So kind of working, but let's make this look better, right?
01:57 Actually, one of our goals is to make register
01:59 also a button, look like login.
02:01 I'm not sure about really the semantics
02:03 of putting it like that, but just for an example.
02:06 So let's start by saying how does it look
02:08 if we just put Bootstrap.
02:11 Looks a little bit better, right?
02:12 The general text input looks better and so on.
02:17 Let's go down here and just put a little style
02:19 on this so you can see it.
02:21 Of course, this would go in CSS, but just
02:22 for the demo, I'm going to just cram this on here.
02:25 Let's put it at least in the style section
02:27 that'll make me feel better.
02:33 So we'll give the forms a little bit of padding
02:34 to to push it away from the edge.
02:36 Let's also do this, let's say width is 500px.
02:41 I'll say that in just a minute.
02:42 We're going to make it look a little bit better
02:44 but let's build it up here.
02:46 So now we've got the margin is 10 on the input
02:49 and so hopefully that looks a little bit better.
02:51 Let's try, woo, it's not amazing, it's
02:54 nowhere near amazing, but it is better.
02:57 So what can we do with Bootstrap?
02:58 Well, let's focus on our buttons
03:00 since that's where we started.
03:01 I want that to be a button, and that to be a button
03:03 and I want 'em to look pretty much the same.
03:06 So in Bootstrap, a lot of this stuff is done
03:08 with classes, so we'll come down here and say
03:11 that first of all I want to treat this like a button
03:14 so I'll say btn, and then what kind of button?
03:18 There's themes that have different styles.
03:20 Is it like a successful thing
03:22 is it a possibly dangerous thing?
03:24 So you say btn either success or danger
03:28 or default or primary, let's go with primary.
03:33 And then we'll do the same thing
03:34 so this is our button in HTML
03:36 and here's our hyperlink, we'll do the same thing here.
03:43 That one's going to be a successful operation.
03:45 We want to encourage them to register, right?
03:48 Refresh, boom, look at that.
03:50 That's pretty sweet, right?
03:52 This one submits the form, this one navigates away
03:55 somewhere we don't have existing, but whatever.
03:57 You can see these are working well.
03:59 And that's pretty much it for buttons.
04:02 You can have small buttons, large buttons
04:03 different colors, I'll show you a little template layout
04:06 or a table of those and what they look like in a second.
04:10 And let's go ahead and round
04:11 out how these things look, right?
04:12 They kind of look a little bit boring.
04:17 We can do better.
04:18 So over here, we can say a class is a form-control
04:23 and sometimes this goes farther than you like.
04:26 It's slightly mobile focused, it trends
04:29 towards focusing on mobile, so you'll see
04:31 in a second, look at that.
04:33 Well, it's like okay that would be great
04:35 that would look super on a screen like this, right?
04:39 But the way it is right now, not so much.
04:42 Let's do a little bit of help on this thing.
04:52 Let's go put a little class on this
04:54 and just say text-align is center.
04:58 Here we go, that looks a little bit better.
05:00 So this is okay, I like the styles, the rounded edge
05:03 everything looks good, but I do have this zoomed, right?
05:06 There's a non-zoom version.
05:09 Whoops. So pretty decent, but when it looks like this
05:13 not so much, what can we do here?
05:15 Let's go and we'll put into our form here
05:19 a login, that looks a little bit better.
05:22 And maybe we'll even
05:29 throw our center on there as well.
05:30 Let's do one little quick thing
05:32 to make this look decent, I'm going to go
05:33 to the form, I'm going to set its max width
05:37 to be 500px, eh, 450, 450.
05:42 And then if we set the margin
05:43 on the left and right to be auto
05:51 it'll just center that.
05:52 And let's go ahead and say background color
05:55 we can even pick, oh it's over here in PyCharm.
05:59 Let's just create a little border
06:04 be it solid gray, I don't really want gray.
06:07 I just want to pick a color like that.
06:10 Okay, how 'about that, pretty decent.
06:13 We need a little bit more, maybe put 10 here.
06:20 Say margin top is 50px.
06:30 And I've noticed for some reason, periodically
06:32 that if you look at this, these extend too far
06:35 to the right by 10 pixels, so we'll just push them
06:38 back maybe a little bit more, 30, rather, instead of 20.
06:42 There we go, so here's our nice little login form
06:44 and it's looking really great.
06:45 We've got our buttons by just having btn
06:48 and then btn-style, right?
06:50 Primary, success, etc. and we threw
06:53 in some form control to make that look good as well.
06:57 If you head over to the training site, you'll see
06:58 that stuff in action all over the place.
07:00 There's a button, go to login, there's your login.
07:05 Here's your reset password.
07:08 If you want to register, there's your register.
07:11 Little CAPTCHA, 'cause people been trying to hack into it.
07:15 And so on, go to these course details
07:18 and we have still more buttons all over the place.
07:22 This one is a hyperlink, this one
07:25 actually submits a form, for example.
