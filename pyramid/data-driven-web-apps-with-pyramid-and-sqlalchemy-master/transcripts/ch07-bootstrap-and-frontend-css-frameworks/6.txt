00:00 So let's come over here
00:01 and we're going to go back to our grid_layouts.html here.
00:05 Now the grid_layouts.html looks like this.
00:08 Let's actually just open it up and have a look;
00:12 looks like this. Now notice these things are wrapped
00:14 but as I make it a little bit larger
00:15 now they're horizontal.
00:17 A little bit more, they're vertical, horizontal and so on.
00:20 And out here, we have these lg.
00:21 If I make it completely wide
00:24 those will be horizontal instead of vertical.
00:28 So what's going on here?
00:29 The way Bootstrap works is it uses 12 slices
00:34 vertical slices of the screen.
00:36 Whatever this overall gray box is contained within
00:40 it's going to break that up into 12 slices.
00:44 Why 12, I don't know. 10 seems reasonable.
00:48 Maybe 10 was not enough.
00:50 I guess because thirds is a lot easier on 12
00:54 but you have basically 12 little slices to work with.
00:57 What we can do is we can say "This part right here
00:59 I would like to be 8 of the 12, or 2/3.
01:03 This one will be 4/12 or just 1/3."
01:06 The other thing that we put in here
01:08 is this md for medium, sm for small, and lg.
01:13 We've already seen this ability when it gets too small
01:16 it'll no longer be horizontal.
01:18 It'll wrap and vertically stack.
01:20 The sm, md, lg talks about how soon that should happen.
01:25 Large, lg, says, "I want it to be this horizontal slice
01:28 but only on large screens."
01:32 As this gets just a little bit smaller
01:33 the large are going to wrap, but medium and small
01:37 they're like this is at least a medium width screen
01:40 so it's fine. Go a little more, and eventually the mediums will snap.
01:44 Boom, they're they go.
01:45 We're still left with the small bits
01:47 and eventually if it gets sufficiently small, we get that.
01:52 One thing that's nice to play with
01:53 is some of the responsive design tools.
01:57 This overall is more broadly classified
01:59 as responsive design.
02:00 What we've seen so far over in Firefox or Chrome.
02:03 We saw the responsive grid features here
02:06 but let's imagine we want to test this on different devices.
02:10 We can come over here and right click
02:11 and say inspect element
02:13 and click on that little thing right there.
02:16 Or we could just hit command option m.
02:18 Take your pick.
02:21 Now we have what you might think of as
02:24 a little embedded phone type of thing here.
02:26 Notice I can scroll in it
02:27 and everything's looking really quite good.
02:30 Got a little menu, you can turn it sideways
02:32 see how things would look as if it were sideways and so on.
02:35 Let's put it vertical.
02:36 How does this look on an iPhone 6 Plus?
02:40 A little wider screen, okay that's good.
02:43 How about on a Google Nexus 7?
02:46 That's wider, right?
02:47 That's nice, so what else?
02:50 Samsung Galaxy 7 looks like this.
02:54 That's really nice isn't it
02:55 so this is a great little tool for testing your design
02:59 on different devices when you're working
03:02 with these responsive grids.
03:04 Instead of always trying to resize your browser
03:05 you're like, how exactly would it look
03:07 on this particular device?
03:09 Well, you can go pick it right there.
