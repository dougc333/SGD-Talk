00:00 Buttons in bootstrap are super, super easy.
00:03 Here you can see a "get updates", where people can subscribe
00:06 to the newsletter for notifications
00:08 on things like new classes and so on.
00:12 Now in here, this is submitting that form
00:14 that posts your email address to the thing
00:16 that actually puts you in the newsletter.
00:18 So this one is a button, and we want it to be
00:21 nice and red, I've heard that red converts well
00:24 even though it's marked as dangerous
00:26 it's somehow attractive.
00:28 So btn and then btn-danger is what we used here.
00:31 You can also do this with links
00:32 so here's a link that just takes you from
00:34 the course's page to the podcast page
00:37 to encourage you to, you know
00:39 get more out of interacting with me basically.
00:42 So here's a link, looks exactly the same
00:45 but here's a hyperlink and we say btn and then btn-primary.
00:49 There are actually different sizes of buttons
00:52 and six different kinds of buttons.
00:54 We have default, primary, success, info, warning, and danger
00:59 and maybe the one, if you don't even put any
01:02 modifier on there, you might get something else
01:05 I'm not sure how great it would look
01:06 and of course there's just the plain link.
01:08 And there's different sizes: just the standard btn
01:11 there's a btn-small, btn-large
01:13 maybe btn-xs I think at the bottom, I'm not sure.
01:15 Extra small or extra large, I'm not sure which way it goes.
01:18 But here's the choices you have
01:20 and primary doesn't always have to be blue
01:23 success doesn't always have to be green, and so on.
01:25 You can of course, override the themes
01:28 to make these buttons look differently.
01:30 But here's the six categories that you get.
