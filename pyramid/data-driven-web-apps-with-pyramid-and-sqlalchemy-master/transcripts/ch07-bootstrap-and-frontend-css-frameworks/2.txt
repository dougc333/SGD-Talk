00:00 Now before we start working with Bootstrap
00:02 let's do a quick survey of what's out there.
00:05 So Bootstrap probably is
00:07 the most popular front-end framework
00:10 for a CSS framework, that's out there.
00:13 And that has a lot of benefits.
00:15 It means one, there's a lot of tutorials and demos
00:18 but also there's a lot of themes
00:20 and other sort of add-ons and extensions.
00:22 So popularity does matter, especially if you want
00:25 to get into the theme side of things.
00:28 But it's not the only thing, right?
00:30 Maybe there's another one you like better.
00:32 Like I said in the opening for this chapter
00:34 we're going to use Bootstrap.
00:35 It's pretty popular, you see, at 125,000 GitHub stars.
00:39 There's a nice URL you can go to, expo.getbootstrap.com
00:43 and there's a bunch of sites built with Bootstrap
00:46 that you can click around and get some inspiration from.
00:49 And it's always view source.
00:50 You can even borrow it to build your own site.
00:54 Another one that's really popular is Symantec.
00:56 So, Symantec UI is a nice framework
00:59 for building clean web apps, and this one has 41,000 stars
01:04 definitely consider that.
01:06 Foundation, Zurb Foundation it's really, really popular.
01:09 This one is a little more popular among
01:11 what I would call, the professional designers
01:14 the people who really do design for a living.
01:17 It does a little less hand-holding.
01:19 It's more of a foundation upon which
01:21 you can build your design.
01:23 Hence, I guess the name Foundation.
01:25 So, if that describes you a little better
01:27 it may be considered checking out Foundation.
01:30 There's Materialize.
01:31 Here's an example of an app built with Materialze.
01:33 Nice and clean, looks really great.
01:35 And there's a whole bunch more.
01:36 Actually, a really great article is this one here
01:39 at KeyCDN, Top 10 Front-End Frameworks of 2016.
01:43 Yeah, it's a 2016, but many of them are still relevant.
01:46 And it's nice, 'cause it actually gives you a little bit
01:49 of the trade-offs, like, "Bootstrap is good like this."
01:51 "But it's not as good as that."
01:52 "This other one, Materialize has this advantage so consider it."
01:56 So if you're actually shopping
01:58 for what front-end framework to use, give that a quick look.
02:01 If you don't know, Bootstrap, that's probably the way to go.
