00:00 So we saw this little grid layout HTML in action here.
00:05 We've got our grid layout, and now let's go and see
00:08 how we define this grid layout itself.
00:12 So maybe we'll do a separate container here.
00:15 Do an h2 and in PyCharm you hit tab and
00:17 it'll expand stuff, that's great.
00:19 So we'll call this new section
00:24 This can be starter section.
00:27 So down here, the way this works
00:29 is you need to have a div that is a container
00:32 and then for each row, you have a div that is a class row.
00:36 Then you break your piece among these divs
00:39 by partitioning the 12.
00:42 So here, 8 and 4. 4, 4, and 4.
00:45 6 and 6, so on.
00:46 PyCharm has a cool zen coding feature
00:49 that lets you write stuff like this more quickly.
00:52 So watch, I'll do div.
00:53 Then how do you say the class in CSS?
00:55 You would say, ".container" right?
00:57 Then you say, "immediately contains" in CSS like this.
01:01 That's a div.row.
01:04 Then what if we want to have three divs
01:07 that have this class right there?
01:12 We can come down here and say, "div dot that times three."
01:15 Now if I hit tab watch, boom.
01:18 It's pretty awesome. So div with the container, div with a row, three things.
01:23 So this will be, thing 1
01:29 thing 2, thing 3.
01:33 Now if we open this up
01:34 we got thing one, thing two, and thing three.
01:36 Remember these are medium, so they're going to break
01:38 at about medium size screen there.
01:42 Okay, so pretty awesome.
01:45 We want one more row, so we could come here div.row
01:49 and maybe want div.
01:53 That multiple always needs to be 12, right?
01:55 So we'll have
01:56 let's say 6 little horizontal slices, like that.
02:00 Now if we look at it, you can see there's those slices.
02:03 By the way, I put a CSS style in this page
02:05 to make it have these little gray borders
02:07 so that they stand out.
02:08 If you didn't add on that extra style
02:15 and you just run it like this
02:16 you would not see those pieces stand out nearly as clearly.
02:19 But the grid is still there, right?
02:21 Notice the behaviors happening is just super hard to see
02:25 so I of course put that in here
02:27 so it stands out in a really obvious way for you.
02:31 Okay, that's really all there is to the grid.
02:34 You can pretty easily use those to design the stuff
02:37 so we come look here.
02:39 You can see we have a container, we have a row
02:42 and then we have a column md 4.
02:45 md 4, md 4, that's how we get our thirds
02:48 right there on that page; super easy.
02:51 And of course, the responsive design bit
02:52 just falls right into place there.
02:54 Oh, last thing on the image is worth pointing out here
02:58 since I don't think we're going to talk about it anywhere else
03:00 these images have the class img and img-responsive.
03:06 Those two things are what are in place
03:09 to make them actually change size
03:11 to match whatever container they're in, okay?
03:15 So, img and img-responsive.
