00:00 Here we are in DigitalOcean.
00:01 Obviously, have an account and am already logged in.
00:05 So what we're going to do is we're going to create
00:06 what's called a droplet, virtual machine.
00:08 There's lots of options.
00:09 We can just pick our various distribution.
00:12 We can actually go and say well
00:14 I could like a discourse server running on
00:17 you know, whatever
00:18 but we're just going to start a Vanilla Linux Ubuntu server.
00:23 If you get the choice to pick something new
00:25 you might as well.
00:26 The .04, the long term releases
00:28 so this is long term, this is long term.
00:31 Might as well pick the newest long term one.
00:32 You'll get the newest version of Python that way.
00:35 We can pick our droplet size.
00:36 Check this out.
00:37 We can get a gig memory terabyte of transfer
00:40 plenty of RAM for $5 a month.
00:43 This server will be able to literally handle millions
00:47 of HTTP data-driven requests, no problem, no problem.
00:53 Think it's going to be more busy than that?
00:54 Go crazy and spend 10 bucks
00:56 but we'll just create this simple, cheap one here.
00:59 You can always change the sizes after you create 'em.
01:01 We don't need available block storage
01:03 but if you want kind of a drive independent
01:06 of your actual server, you can set that up there.
01:08 I'm going to pick just something close to me.
01:10 Normally, I would run it in New York
01:13 somewhere on the east coast.
01:15 Given my customer base, a lot of people from the US
01:18 lot of people from Europe and east coast is pretty much
01:22 as good as it gets, so, anyway.
01:24 I'm in Oregon, so we're going to pick San Francisco.
01:26 That's close as it gets.
01:28 Include monitoring.
01:29 If you don't have an SSH key, go and create it here
01:32 and put it there, but I've got some already.
01:35 I checked 'em all 'cause I couldn't remember
01:36 which one I have on this user profile
01:39 and then it just says give it a name
01:40 so this is going to be the PyPI server.
01:44 How 'about that?
01:46 And then all we do is click create.
01:49 You can see it's creating it.
01:58 Alright, our droplet has been created.
02:00 We have an Ubuntu 18 server running in San Francisco.
02:05 It's IP address is that.
02:06 There's lots of nice little copy these things here.
02:09 So it looks like it's about ready
02:11 for us to go interact with it.
02:12 We're effectively done with DigitalOcean.
02:15 Now, let's do one thing really quick here.
02:21 What we're going to do is I'm going to go
02:22 over here and edit our server
02:28 and we're just going to put fake_pypi.com as the name.
02:32 So I copied that IP address and I put it here
02:35 and this will let us go over here and like ping that URL.
02:40 As far as our system is concerned
02:42 that thing is alive, and 30 millisecond ping time
02:44 that's pretty solid, especially since
02:46 my network is actually quite busy right now.
02:49 How do we get to it?
02:50 Well, we don't need that for a minute.
02:53 We're going to SSH there
02:54 and this is super easy on Mac and Linux.
02:56 On Windows, you might have to install something like PuTTY.
02:59 Just google SSH server Windows.
03:03 I want to SSH to root@fake_pypi.com.
03:07 Now, that only works because I put that in the host file.
03:10 If you don't edit that, and also in Windows
03:13 that host file's in a different location.
03:15 The host file is c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
03:22 It's been a long since I've edited that
03:24 but I think that's where it is.
03:26 Alright, let's go.
03:28 The very first time you connect
03:30 its going to say we've not see this before.
03:31 You sure you want to go here? Yes.
03:35 Now it's going to log in and say this thing is up and going
03:39 but you know, it's a shade bit out of date
03:41 so the very first thing we've got to do as soon
03:44 as we turn this on is apt update
03:46 to get all the latest possible changes
03:49 and then upgrade it right away. apt upgrade.
03:54 We'll let it do that.
03:56 You don't want to have a server running on the internet
03:58 that potentially has like security holes
04:00 or other issues hanging around
04:02 so let's upgrade it, update it straight away.
04:11 Ooh, that was a lot of updating.
04:12 Took a couple minutes, but I sped up time there.
04:15 That's an awesome power I have, isn't it?
04:16 Okay, so this thing is all updated
04:18 but if you exit and came back, you would see it says
04:21 a reboot is required, a restart is required.
04:23 So let's do that before we do anything further.
04:27 Now, I think that actually upgraded
04:29 from kernel 22 to 25 which means
04:34 that's probably going to take a moment to do
04:36 when we restart here, and normally
04:37 get back in in a few seconds, five, six, 10 seconds.
04:41 Probably, we're not there yet.
04:44 Ooh, speedy. That was very fast.
04:45 Okay, no, not 25. 23.
04:47 But it did upgrade it and it looks
04:49 like there's now zero updates.
04:50 We have a fully patched Linux server.
04:54 Ubuntu 18.04 ready to do our bidding.
04:57 Now we're going to start setting it up to be our server.
05:00 Going to install Nginx.
05:01 We're going to install uWSGI and configure Python
05:04 all the things that we need to do.
