00:00 The final building block
00:01 that we're going to talk about here are templates.
00:03 Templates are super important.
00:05 They let us define in an HTML-like fashion
00:10 the general markup for our site
00:12 and then add little bits of
00:14 dynamic behavior to it.
00:16 There's actually three choices we can use
00:18 for the template language.
00:20 We can use Mako,
00:22 we can use Jinja2,
00:23 or we can use Chameleon templates.
00:26 This is a Chameleon template here,
00:29 and I'll talk later about why
00:31 I think Chameleon is the right choice.
00:32 But let's just see how this works.
00:34 It's kind of the same for all the template languages.
00:37 So what we're going to do is we saw that we passed
00:39 a model over that had packages, right.
00:43 One of the keys in the model was packages,
00:45 and the value was actually a list of packages.
00:50 We're going to use tal:repeat and I'm going to say
00:52 for every package in packages,
00:55 I want to replicate this HTML block,
00:58 including the DIV that has the tal:repeat on it.
01:01 So we'll have a DIV containing a hyperlink
01:04 in a span for every package.
01:06 And then for the hyperlink
01:07 we need to set the URL,
01:09 so within this little repeat loop
01:10 we can say p.url,
01:12 p.name and so on.
01:14 And then we're going to show the summary
01:17 but only if the summary exists.
01:19 Like if there's an empty summary or it's not set,
01:21 then we're not going to show it.
01:22 So you can see that if we want to take some sort of text
01:26 or anything and get a string version of it
01:28 and just plunk it into the page,
01:30 we'll use dollar curly expression.
01:33 We can do these conditions with tal:condition
01:36 and so on.
01:37 Often when we take this
01:39 and actually pass that data to it and render it,
01:42 that pyramid render it,
01:43 it's going to look like this:
01:44 requests, Http For Humans, boto3, AWS API
01:48 and SQLAlchemy and so on.
01:49 Cause that was the model of the three packaged requests
01:53 Boto3 and SQLAlchemay passed along to this template.
01:56 So that's what its going to look like.
01:58 Unstyled and ugly of course,
02:00 we're going to work on that later.
