00:00 Let's spend a moment on the Pyramid philosophy
00:03 and some of the principles that they use
00:05 to drive their project.
00:06 I love their tagline:
00:08 The start small, finish big, and stay finished framework.
00:12 You'll see that the principles
00:13 really drive that mission statement there.
00:16 First of all, they focus on simplicity,
00:19 and the pay-only-for-what-you-eat approach.
00:22 And what that means is they've designed the framework
00:25 so that you can get results even if you have
00:28 only a partial understanding of Pyramid.
00:30 You don't need to understand all the stuff
00:32 in order to make use of it.
00:34 You just need to know how to, say,
00:35 create a view and a template and pass data to it.
00:38 That's really all you need to know
00:39 if you just want to show simple data, things like that.
00:42 So they've built this start small and add your understanding
00:47 to do more and more advanced stuff over time
00:49 but if you don't care about it,
00:50 you don't need to know about it, and that's really nice.
00:53 Being a microframework, they focus on minimalism;
00:57 the core things that web applications do:
00:59 mapping URLs to code, templating,
01:02 security, and static assets.
01:04 And that's pretty much it.
01:05 Every web application has to do stuff like this,
01:07 so that's what they've focused on,
01:09 doing this really fast and really well.
01:13 Because Pyramid's relatively small,
01:15 they can focus on having documentation for everything.
01:19 So their goal is to make sure nothing goes undocumented.
01:22 And I could tell you, I've submitted a couple of PRs
01:24 back to various aspects of Pyramid
01:26 and a lot of the conversation actually has been,
01:29 well, what are the effects of this change
01:31 on the documentation, on the tutorials,
01:33 and making sure that that's always up to date.
01:36 Maybe even more so than,
01:38 is this the right change for the framework?
01:40 So I can tell you they take documentation super seriously.
01:44 We talked about focusing
01:46 on the core things the web framework does,
01:48 routing URLs, serving static assets, and so on,
01:51 and I can tell you that Pyramid
01:53 is one of the fastest Python web frameworks out there.
01:57 It's super fast, really runs well,
01:59 and it runs well on Python 3.
02:01 Some of the frameworks out there,
02:02 you'll see they run pretty fast on Python 2
02:04 but not on Python 3,
02:05 and nobody wants to be in that place these days, right?
02:08 Python 2 is on its way out, so having this run fast
02:11 on Python 3 is really, really awesome.
02:14 I can give you a little bit of background
02:15 just running Pyramid for my web applications,
02:18 both the podcast website
02:20 and the training website run on Pyramid.
02:22 I've had various things of those sites each featured
02:27 on Hacker News, and be on the front page,
02:30 in the top five or top 10 on Hacker News for a day or two,
02:34 and that sends a ton of traffic over.
02:36 You go over to the web server, pull it up,
02:38 it's like a $5/10 web server, virtual machine,
02:41 and it's doing like 5/10% CP usage
02:45 even though it's just getting hammered
02:47 with all this traffic. So this framework is super fast and easy on the hardware,
02:51 and really, really scales in some impressive ways.
02:55 We obviously want our web frameworks to be reliable,
02:58 and it's really encouraging that every release of Pyramid
03:01 has 100% statement coverage for their unit tests.
03:04 That's awesome.
03:06 Pyramid is open source and released
03:09 under a permissive license.
03:10 You can see your github.com/pylon/pyramid,
03:13 and you can go check it out, download it, clone it,
03:16 do whatever you want so you'll always
03:18 have access to your web framework.
03:22 One of the first things that drew me to Pyramid was actually
03:25 it's super strong support for Python 3.
03:29 So they made a statement early on saying,
03:32 Python 3 is the future,
03:33 Python 3 is going to be our default implementation.
03:36 Yes, it may still run on Python 2,
03:39 but we are going to build all of our demos,
03:42 build all of our examples,
03:43 and primarily test and develop on Python 3,
03:47 and make sure things run fast on Python 3.
03:50 Which they've done really well, and that's awesome.
03:53 You definitely need to be on Python 3 these days,
03:55 Python 2 is on its way out really, really soon.
03:58 At the 2020 deadline, it's basically going unsupported
04:02 and you do not want to be built on a framework
04:04 or a runtime that's unsupported.
04:07 So the fact that Python 3 is the default implementation
04:10 for Pyramid is just excellent.
