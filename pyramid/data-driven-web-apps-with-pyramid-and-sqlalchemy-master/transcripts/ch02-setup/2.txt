00:00 We'll be doing a ton of live demos
00:01 and almost every bit of code and concept covered
00:04 will be done in some form of a live demo.
00:08 That means we need a really solid editor.
00:10 We're going to use PyCharm.
00:12 I'm going to use PyCharm for this course.
00:14 And you, if you want to follow along exactly
00:16 should also use PyCharm.
00:18 It's in my opinion the best editor
00:20 at the moment for Python.
00:22 If you don't want to use PyCharm for whatever reason
00:24 you can use whatever editor you'd like.
00:26 If you want another recommendation
00:28 one that's free, the Visual Studio Code
00:31 with the Python plugin is looking like really
00:34 the second best option these days.
00:37 And it's really good, and it's really coming along.
00:39 One other thing about PyCharm
00:41 they have a community free edition
00:43 and they have a pro paid edition.
00:46 Often, the community free edition is totally good
00:48 and you can use it for writing
00:50 all kinds of stuff in Python.
00:52 However, one of the paid features
00:55 is web and database support.
00:57 This is a class about web and database programming
01:00 so as you might expect, you're going to have to have
01:02 the professional edition of PyCharm
01:04 to make full use of it with this course.
01:06 If you don't have or want to get
01:08 the professional edition of PyCharm
01:10 you can follow along with VS Code.
01:12 You can sort of follow along with the community edition
01:15 with a few little hacks to make it run.
01:18 But you won't get the full editor
01:19 to support in PyCharm community.
01:22 Be sure to get the right version
01:23 to get the most out of this course.
