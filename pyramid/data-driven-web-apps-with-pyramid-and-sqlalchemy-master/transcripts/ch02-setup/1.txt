00:00 I'm sure you're ready to get in and start learning
00:02 about Pyramid and building the web apps right away
00:05 but before we do, let's just take a quick moment
00:08 and make sure you have everything you need
00:09 to follow along and write and run these programs.
00:13 Obviously, you're going to need Python, right?
00:15 This is a Python course
00:17 and in fact we're going to use Python 3.
00:21 Python 2 will go unsupported
00:22 in less than two years from now
00:24 so of course we're using Python 3.
00:26 However, Python 3 doesn't come on all the systems.
00:29 Let's see if you have Python.
00:30 How do you know whether you have Python?
00:32 Well, you can go to your terminal
00:34 on a Mac or on Linux and type python3 -V
00:39 and it'll tell you either no there is no Python 3
00:41 or it'll tell you what version.
00:43 When I ran this command it was 3.6
00:45 but actually 3.7 just came out so Python 3.7 is the latest.
00:49 As long as you have 3.5 or later, you'll be fine.
00:52 If you're on Windows this doesn't work.
00:54 It's a little frustrating but python3 is not a command
00:57 that comes installed with Python by default.
01:00 How do you know what you have on Windows?
01:01 Well, you could type python -V
01:04 and that'll tell you what one of your installations is
01:07 if it's in the path.
01:08 It might be better to ask where python
01:10 and it will show you all the different locations
01:12 and then you can type python -V and see which one.
01:15 For example, on this Windows 10 machine
01:16 we have the Anaconda 3 Python
01:19 which is Python 3 from the Anaconda distribution.
01:22 We have Python 3.6 from Python.org, and 3.5 from Python.org
01:29 all in these random, different locations here.
01:31 So you can adjust your path to target the one that you want
01:34 but make sure when you type python -V
01:37 you get something Python 3.5 or higher.
01:41 Depending on your OS if you type this
01:42 and everything works
01:43 you're ready to take this class.
01:44 You have Python set up.
01:47 But what if you don't?
01:48 Maybe you need Python, maybe that didn't work.
01:50 There actually a whole bunch of tradeoffs
01:53 and different ways to install Python.
01:55 One way, if you're on Mac or Windows, is just go Python.org
01:59 download the latest installer, and get it.
02:01 But I want to give you a little more guidance.
02:03 Drop over at realpython.com/installing-python
02:07 and have a look there.
02:09 They have for each of the operating systems
02:10 a couple of different ways.
02:11 For example, for Mac OS, you might use Homebrew
02:14 to install and update the latest version of Python.
02:17 Things like that.
02:18 So go over here, see what they say for your OS.
02:21 They're going to keep maintaining this
02:22 and updating it over time.
02:23 So this is probably the best resource
02:25 for installing Python if you need to do so.
02:28 Once you get Python set up
02:29 you'll be ready to move on.
