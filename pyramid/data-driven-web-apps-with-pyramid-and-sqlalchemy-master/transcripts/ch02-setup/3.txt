00:00 Everything you see me write.
00:01 Every bit of code that we create and all the stuff
00:04 that we generate during this course and even some
00:07 of the raw data needed to generate
00:09 that is available for you on GitHub.
00:12 So I encourage you to drop over here
00:14 at GitHub.com/talkpython/
00:17 here's a long one
00:18 data-driven-web-apps-with-pyramid-and-sqlalchemy
00:21 separated by dashes.
00:23 Go over there and star and fork this repository star
00:27 so you can get back to it and fork it, of course
00:28 so you have a permanent copy in your GitHub account.
00:31 If you don't want to, you can just go to the clone
00:34 and download button and download the zip.
00:35 But I recommend that you link it to your GitHub account.
00:38 That way you have access to it forever.
00:41 So if you're wondering how something worked
00:43 dropped over here in the GitHub repository and check it out.
00:46 There's a section that has the various versions
00:49 the various chapters.
00:51 Every single chapter we have a
00:52 separate saved copy of what we built.
00:55 You can go and see exactly what was built.
00:57 There's a before and after section.
01:00 So that you can compare and see
01:02 what was done during just that chapter.
01:04 Alright, so, be sure to grab this.
01:06 And, and get it yourself.
01:07 We're ready to go.
01:08 You could start from scratch and follow along.
01:10 But like I said, at some point, you'll need, like
01:12 the data and stuff to generate, say, the database.
