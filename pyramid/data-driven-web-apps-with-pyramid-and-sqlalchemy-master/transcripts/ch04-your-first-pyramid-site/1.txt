00:00 I don't know how you feel,
00:01 but I think there has been enough talking.
00:03 It's time to write some code
00:04 and start creating some software.
00:07 So, that's what this chapter kicks off.
00:09 We're going to create our first project.
00:11 And we'll see that there's actually
00:12 a couple ways to do this
00:13 either with a command-line interface
00:14 which applies everywhere
00:16 or a simplified, shorter way with PyCharm.
00:19 I'll show them both of you.
00:21 But let's talk about how we get started
00:23 in Pyramid in general.
00:25 So, every web framework has its own style of scaffolding
00:29 or the putting the structures in place
00:31 so you can get started.
00:33 So, here, what we're going to use
00:34 is a thing called Cookiecutter.
00:36 So, Cookiecutter is an arbitrary Python utility
00:40 that takes starter projects for all sorts of things
00:43 for Pyramid web apps
00:44 but also for Flask and Django,
00:47 and even old Atari-type things written in C
00:50 and you can create projects from them
00:53 and sort of get a headstart on that structure.
00:56 So, we're going to use the Cookiecutter packages
00:59 for Pyramid to do this.
01:00 This is the official way recommended by the Pyramid folks.
01:04 Once we've installed Cookiecutter
01:06 just pip install cookiecutter,
01:07 we're going to use it to create a site.
01:10 Now there's several different types
01:13 of templates we could use.
01:15 Within those projects
01:16 we have choices like what templating engine
01:19 do you want to use, or things like that.
01:21 So, there's a lot of flexibility here
01:22 but we'll just start with what they call the starter site.
01:26 We're going to create a virtual environment.
01:27 This typically, the virtual environment you want that
01:29 to reflect what you're running on the server
01:32 what your target environment is
01:33 and the way to control that really carefully
01:35 is have a dedicated separate Python environment
01:37 for your web app.
01:39 So, we'll do that here.
01:40 Not required, but very much recommended.
01:43 And then we're going to register the site as a package.
01:46 Pyramid's decided that their web applications
01:48 are best deployed as packages
01:51 and manages packages.
01:52 So, we'll see that there's an extra command
01:55 that you have to run here and say
01:56 "Here's the package that I'm working on,
01:58 "install it into this Python environment."
02:00 Not much to do
02:01 but it's easy to forget
02:02 so I'll show you how to do that.
02:04 And finally, we're ready to run our application.
02:06 We're going to serve it up, interact with it.
02:08 We'll add some features,
02:10 and then we're going to go back
02:12 serve it up again, test it
02:13 and we'll just keep adding and adding and iterating.
02:15 So, these first four steps,
02:17 we're going to do to get started
02:18 and of course, you just build software over time
02:21 by adding feature after feature after feature.
02:25 And so as I said in the opening,
02:27 we can use PyCharm or we can use the command-line.
02:29 First, let's talk about a way of doing this
02:32 that works for everybody no matter what OS you're on
02:35 no matter what tooling you're using.
02:37 This command-line interface path will work for you.
02:40 It takes a couple steps
02:41 but once you get used to it
02:42 it's no big deal at all.
