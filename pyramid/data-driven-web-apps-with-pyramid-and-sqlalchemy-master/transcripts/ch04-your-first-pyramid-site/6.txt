00:00 Let's review creating Pyramid web apps with PyCharm.
00:04 So remember, we just go new project, and we pick Pyramid
00:08 and then we pick a new virtual environment.
00:10 We set the location, which basically names our website.
00:13 And make sure you expand out the more settings
00:15 and choose Starter and Chameleon.
00:18 So Pyramid, virtual environment, Starter and Chameleon.
00:22 Basically, it solves a whole bunch of those things
00:24 we did at once.
00:27 And then the final thing to do is to run the setup.py task
00:30 in development mode.
00:32 Now, if you don't get that little dialogue that says
00:34 hey you need to run it this way
00:35 you can go to tools, run setup.py task
00:37 and just type develop.
00:39 But the newest version of PyCharm typically
00:41 finds that and you just click that little bar
00:43 that comes up across the top.
00:45 Then you're ready to run your app.
00:46 How do you run it?
00:47 Well, you click that little play button
00:49 and it runs, and then you go interact with it.
00:51 Easiest way to do that is just to click the hyperlink
00:53 at the bottom and boom, your site's up and running.
00:57 So this is really a nice way to create new projects.
00:59 Honestly, I don't use it very often these days.
01:02 When I was new to Pyramid, I would use PyCharm
01:06 to create those projects and it helped a lot.
01:07 The more I got good at working with Pyramid directly
01:12 I find myself going to the command line more
01:14 and sort of doing stuff manually.
01:16 But either way is totally fine
01:18 this is certainly a good way to get started
01:20 because it helps you through a lot of the steps
01:22 and it makes it real, real simple.
