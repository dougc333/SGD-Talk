00:00 So you've seen how to create a Pyramid website
00:02 using Cookiecutter, virtual environments
00:05 and what not on the command line.
00:07 Let's review those steps
00:08 so that you have a nice, clear series to follow.
00:12 Okay, so, what do we do?
00:13 We started by sayin' we're going to use Cookiecutter
00:16 and we're going to need a template to work with.
00:18 So I use the Pyramid Cookiecutter starter template.
00:20 Just copy that URL and we're going to feed it to Cookiecutter,.
00:23 You can use any one of the five actually
00:26 if you feel they match what you're doing better.
00:30 So we got to make sure we have Cookiecutter installed.
00:32 So pip install cookiecutter
00:34 maybe throw a -U for upgrade
00:37 a --user so it doesn't require sudo
00:40 things like that.
00:41 But here we go it's going to get it going.
00:42 That's great.
00:44 We pip install cookiecutter
00:46 and then we're going to create the scaffolding.
00:48 We want to create the site using Cookiecutter.
00:51 So we'll say cookiecutter and we'll give it
00:53 the URL to the template.
00:55 It's going to ask a bunch of questions.
00:57 If you want to follow along
00:58 make sure you choose 2 here for your project
01:01 otherwise there's going to be trouble.
01:03 Alright, great, so you choose that
01:05 you answer the various questions
01:07 and it gives you a few steps to follow after that.
01:10 It says go to the project, create a virtual environment.
01:13 Make sure you upgrade pip inside of tools
01:16 because Python doesn't do that for you.
01:18 How frustrating but that's the way it goes.
01:20 And then, once you've registered the project
01:25 we'll be up and running and then you can serve it up.
01:30 Oh, what's that look like?
01:31 Well, we're going to run python3 -m venv.
01:35 Some versions of Mac and python intersected with PyCharm
01:40 all require this --copies.
01:42 If you have the latest version of everything
01:44 you don't need it but you can throw that
01:46 on there if you're finding you're having trouble.
01:48 So we're going to create our virtual environment
01:50 and we can activate it.
01:52 Say source .env/bin/activate on Mac or Linux
01:57 on Windows it's just .env\scripts\activate.bat
02:01 and then you can ask well which Python or where Python
02:04 should be the one in your virtual environment.
02:06 Then final step is to install the dependencies
02:09 install Pyramid, and to register the site with Python.
02:13 So python setup.py develop.
02:19 Everything should be up and running and working.
02:21 It's just time to serve up your app.
02:23 Open the web server and start interacting with it.
02:26 So pserve and give it one of your configurations
02:29 probably development.ini.
02:31 What'd you get?
02:32 Well you get your site up and running of course.
02:35 So really nice, here we are on the close
02:37 looking at our starter project just like we did in the demo.
