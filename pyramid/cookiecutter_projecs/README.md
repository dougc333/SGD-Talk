most of the projects with all the odd files which I cant figure out are autogenerated from cookiecutter. 
That was the common practice 10y ago! 

The templates use Jinja2 or Mako or Chameleon. That has been replaced by jsx/tsx under the JS frameworks. 
Not uncommon now to have python/JS servers with separate APIs. 
Should have a command line API in addition to webviews.
