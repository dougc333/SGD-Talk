this loadash_lib is the first example from the webpack docs
this is a starter example with no webpack.config.js and no list
of plugins required for react. 

Mostly a waste of time 

Follow instrustions from https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

to run npx webpack which runs webpack with default configuraiton

to customize you have to create a webpack.config.js and run
npm webpack 

this runs npm locally in the npm installed version in package.json
