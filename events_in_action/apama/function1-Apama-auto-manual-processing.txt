In this function contained in the corresponding .wmf file, there are two cases.

In the auto case, the system waits for the first DeliveryBid, then sends out
the Assignment when receiving the first bid (and then continues monitoring the
delivery process.)  

In the manual case, the systems listens for all delivery bids from drivers who
would respond, then groups these bids by ranking (so that after two minutes, it
can select the five highest ranking bids and send them to the store.)
