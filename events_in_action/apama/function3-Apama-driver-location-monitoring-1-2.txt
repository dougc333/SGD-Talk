In this function contained in the two corresponding .wmf files, the system is 
monitoring drivers' GPS location changes.  With each driver's location change,
the system dynamically changes the filtering criteria of selecting the matching
drivers on the delivery requests.  This is easily achieved by terminating the 
old listener for the old set of criteria, and re-establish a new listener for 
the new set of criteria at run-time.
