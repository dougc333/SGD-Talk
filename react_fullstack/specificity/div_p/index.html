<h1> Specificity </h1>
<div>
<p>Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS decl. Determined by 
  teh number of each selector type in the matching selector. When multiple decls
  have equal Specificity the last decl in the css is applied. Specificity only applies
  when the same element is targeted by multiple decls. As per css rules directly targeted elements
  will always take precedence over rules which an element inherits from its ancestor. 
</p>
<p>Specificity vs cascade. <em>Cascade means the order rules are applied.</em> Cascade is used to resolve
  Specificity confilcts. For equal Specificity the cascade rules implement the last rule on teh element
