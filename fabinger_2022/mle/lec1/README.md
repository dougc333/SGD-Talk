test data fitting to MLE
the distributions depend on the type of data
count data, categorical data with 2 categories, categorical data wiht multiple categories

what happens if you have a data type which doesnt fit? 
you cant make all gene data real numbers can you? real numbers are range bound

or real numbers which take only certain values. not continuous. 
like words in a vocabulary. how are these encoded? many ways. 
a single distribution doesnt fit.
