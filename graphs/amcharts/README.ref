1) import libs, set id=chartdiv in body, am5.Root.new(), am5xy.ValueAxis.new()
2) create x, y axis, add X, Y renderer, need 1 renderer per axis. Add tooltip into renderer
3) add series, into chart.series. Each series has data property where you set data. 
line should only need 2 points. Do you need display.xx methods to draw the line? 
series has as "draw" property?
