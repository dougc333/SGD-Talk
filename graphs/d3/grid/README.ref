line.html test how margin works and how to make cross at origin using negative x, y coordinates 
now replace the line.html with scaleLInear which adds the labels. 

line.html vs. line2.html. If you dont set the height and width to include margins as in line.html you 
have to remove 2x the margins later when setting drawing area. line2.html more confusing than line.html 
because of 2 factor.
