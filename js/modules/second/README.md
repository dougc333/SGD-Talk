use var = APP to encapsulate fns and objects

use a wrapper function in dom.js and users.js. The wrapper function is defined and executed in dom.js and users.js. 
This makes the wrappers global but the functions and variables are not global. 


create bundler for dom.js and users.js after adding exports verify working but CORS errors
so have to bundle in server
